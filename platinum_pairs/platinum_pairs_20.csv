1329,9g32v7bK3Co,stanford,"Okay? Let's try it out for tram.
Again, remember tram can fail, so I'm gonna get two things here.
So these are the things I'm going to get for tram, I'm going to either end up in six with probability 0.5 with the reward of minus 2 or I will not go anywhere.
I'm still at three with probability 0.5 and that is with a reward of minus 2.
Okay? All right.
So that was just the tram problem and we formalized it as an MDP.
Again, the reason it's an MDP is, is that the tram can fail with probability 0.5.
So we added that in, then we defined our transition function and our problem- and our reward function.
Okay? All right, everyone happy with how we are defining MDPs? Yeah? Okay.
Pretty similar to search problems except for now we have these probabilities, okay? All right.
So, so now I have defined an MDP, that's great.
The next question that in general we would like to answer is to give a solution, right? So there's a question here.","1. What is a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and how does it relate to the tram problem?

1675,iTMn0Kt18tg,mit_cs,"Number 1 will be here.
It has no imaginary part, so it's on the x-axis-- this is the real line down here-- and it's at position 1, which I'm going to just define to be right there.

That's over here.
Then we got i.
That's here, 1 times i.

I square this.
I get a half.
I square this I get a half.
I add them together, I get what? Take the square root, I still get 1, so this distance is 1.
Interesting.
And then I got the negative of that, which is over here, and a negative of that.
Then this is the-- with a negative-- did I get it wrong? Yep, sorry.
It doesn't matter, but I'll think of it as i minus-- killed a chalk-- i minus 1.

And then for this particular method, I'm going to give it another parameter, and I can name this whatever I want.
I'm naming it other.
And this is going to represent the other coordinate object for which I want to find the distance from my self.
So here I'm going to just implement the Euclidean distance formula, which is x1 minus x2 squared, plus Y1 minus Y2 squared, and square root of all that.

1834,TOb1tuEZ2X4,mit_cs,"All right.
So that's the thing.
So also the leaves obviously don't have children, so this condition is violated by the leaf.
So that's the basic structure of a B-tree.
So the first operation we'll consider on B-trees is searching.
So that should be relatively straightforward.
So remember how searching is done in the binary search tree.
You bring in a value x compared to the key.
Let's say x is less than K, you go down this path.
Let's say x is greater than K, you go down this path.
So similarly in a B-tree.
So let's say we bring in a value.
Let's say you are looking for 20.
So you bring in 20 compared to this.
20 is less than 30, so you go down here.
Now you have two values.
So where does 20 fit in here? Not here.
Not here.
It fits here.
OK.
Go down this tree.

2709,soZv_KKax3E,mit_cs,"Well, let's test the standard error of the mean.
So here's a slightly longer piece of code.
I'm going to look at a bunch of different sample sizes, from 25 to 600, 50 trials each.
So getHighs is just a function that returns the temperatures.
I'm going to get the standard deviation of the whole population, then the standard error of the means and the sample standard deviations, both.
And then I'm just going to go through and run it.
So for size and sample size, I'm going to append the standard error of the mean.
And remember, that uses the population standard deviation and the size of the sample.
So I'll compute all the SEMs.
And then I'm going to compute all the actual standard deviations, as well.
And then we'll produce a bunch of plots-- or a plot, actually.
All right, so let's see what that plot looks like.
Pretty striking.
So we see the blue solid line is the standard deviation of the 50 means.
And the red dotted line is the standard error of the mean.
So we can see, quite strikingly here, that they really track each other very well.","1. Is the standard error of the mean (SEM) always smaller than the standard deviation of the population?

Well, that's all well and good when we're doing simulations.

And it's too hard to do it over and over again.
Think about political polls.

That would be a lot more informative.
So by default, when you create your own type, when you print the object of that type, Python tells you this sort of information which is not what you want.
So what you need to do is you need to define your own method that tells Python what to do when you call print on an object of this type.
So this is going to be a special method, just like init is, because it starts and ends with double underscores.
And the name of the method is underscore, underscore, str, underscore, underscore.

So this is part two.
If you missed part one, go back and watch part one.
Last time, we talked about binary trees in general.
We had each node stored an item, and also a left pointer and a right pointer to other nodes, and a parent pointer to another node.
This was an example of a tree.
B, and C are A's children.
A is the parent of B and C, and also the root of the entire tree.
We defined the height of a node.

12,5Bx5UhrJbJI,stanford,"This slide has a bunch of other annotations on it.
And the reason I included them is that the course repository includes a reference implementation of an autoencoder and all the other deep learning models that we cover in pure NumPy.
And so if you want it to understand all of the technical details of how the model is constructed and optimized, you could use this as a kind of cheat sheet to understand how the code works.
I think the fundamental idea that you want to have is simply that the model is trying to reconstruct its inputs.
The error signal that we get is the difference between the reconstructed and actual input.
And that error signal is what we use to update the parameters of the model.
Final thing I would mention here is that it could be very difficult for this model if you feed in the raw current vectors down here.
They have very high dimensionality.
And their distribution is highly skewed as we've seen.

2517,esmzYhuFnds,mit_cs,"So we start with a non-empty list of examples.
That's what init does.
You can imagine what the code looks like, or you can look at it.
Update is interesting in that it takes the cluster and examples and puts them in-- if you think of k-means in the cluster closest to the previous centroids and then returns the amount the centroid has changed.
So if the centroid has changed by 0, then you don't have anything, right? Creates the new cluster.
And the most interesting thing is computeCentroid.
And if you look at this code, you can see that I'm a slightly unreconstructed Python 2 programmers.
I just noticed this.
I really shouldn't have written 0.0.
I should have just written 0, but in Python 2, you had to write that 0.0.
Sorry about that.
Thought I'd fixed these.
Anyway, so how do we compute the centroid? We start by creating an array of all 0s.
The dimensionality is the number of features in the example.
It's one of the methods from-- I didn't put up on the PowerPoint.
And then for e in examples, I'm going to add to vals e.getFeatures, and then I'm just going to divide vals by the length of self.examples, the number of examples.
So now you see why I made it a pylab array, or a numpy array rather than a list, so I could do nice things like divide the whole thing in one expression.
As you do math, any kind of math things, you'll find these arrays are incredibly convenient.
Rather than having to write recursive functions or do bunches of iterations, the fact that you can do it in one keystroke is incredibly nice.","1. What is clustering, and how is it used in data analysis?

2553,MjbuarJ7SE0,mit_cs,"So z is func_c.
Just mapping parameters from actual to formal.
Then what do we do inside func_c? We print out inside func_c, and then we return z.
This is the cool part.
Inside func_c, z is func_a.
So if you replace z with func_a, this here becomes return func_a open close parentheses.
Look familiar? We did that function call right there right? So that's just another function call.
So with that being another function call, you're going to create another scope, and you're going to pop into that one.
So we're one, two, I guess two scopes deep, and we're trying to figure out where we're going.
So func_a's scope is going to be up here.
So what does func_a do? It just prints out this, and it returns None.
So we're going to return None to whoever called us, which was func_c.
So this line here becomes return None.
And so this line here is going to return None to whoever called it, which was this line down here.
Oops, I didn't mean to cross that out.
So that line here is going to print None.

So we can just return it or the node, depending on what you're looking for.

If you think of an array like this, what does binary search do? It first looks at the key in the middle.

That if you run this algorithm called Newton's method you might need only 10 iterations to get a very good value of theta.
But each iteration will be more expensive.
We'll talk about pros and cons in a second.
But, um, let's see how- let's- let's describe this algorithm which is sometimes much faster for gradient than gradient ascent for optimizing the value of theta.
Okay? So what we'd like to do is, uh, all right, so let me- let me use this simplified one-dimensional problem to describe Newton's method.
So I'm going to solve a slightly different problem with Newton's method which is say you have some function f, right, and you want to find a theta such that f of theta is equal to 0.
Okay? So this is a problem that Newton's method solves.
And the way we're going to use this later is what you really want is to maximize L of theta, right, and well at the maximum the first derivative must be 0.","1. What is gradient ascent, and how does it work in the context of optimization?

Today we're going to continue the theme of randomization and data structures.
Last time we saw skip lists.
Skip lists solve the predecessor-successor problem.
You can search for an item and if it's not there, you get the closest item on either side in log n with high probability.

Today we're going to solve a slightly different problem, the dictionary problem with hash tables.
Something you already think you know.
But we're going to show you how much you didn't know.
But after today you will know.
And we're going to get constant time and not with high probability.
That's hard.
But we'll do constant expected time.
So that's in some sense better.
It's going to solve a weaker problem.
But we're going to get tighter bound constant instead of logarithmic.
So for starters let me remind you what problem we're solving and the basics of hashing which you learned in 6006.
I'm going to give this problem a name because it's important and we often forget to distinguish between two types of things.

So in this case it would generally be a delayed reward, for a long time there're going to be dishes on the counter, er, unless it can just sweep all of them off and have them crash onto the floor, which may or may not be the intended goal of the person who's writing the system.

224,rmVRLeJRkl4,stanford,"And now let's do the dumbest thing that we know, how to turn this into a probability distribution.
Well, what do we do? Well firstly, well taking a dot product of two vectors that might come out as positive or negative, but well we want to have probabilities.
We can't have negative probabilities.
So a simple way to avoid negative probabilities is to exponentiate them, because then we know everything is positive.
And so then we are always getting a positive number in the numerator, but for probabilities we also want to have the numbers add up to 1.
So we have a probability distribution.
So we just normalizing the obvious way, where we divide through by the sum of the numerator quantity for each different word in the vocabulary, and so then necessarily that gives us a probability distribution.
So all the rest of that I was just talking through what we're using there is what's called the softmax function.
So the softmax function will take any R in vector and turn it into things between 0 to 1.
And so we can take numbers and put them through the softmax, and turn them into the redistribution.
So the name comes from the fact that it's sort of like a max.
So because of the fact that we exponentiate, that really emphasizes the big contents in the different dimensions of calculating similarity.
So most of the probability goes to the most similar things, and it's called soft because well, it doesn't do that absolutely.
It'll still give some probability to everything that's in the slightest bit similar-- I mean, on the other hand it's a slightly weird name because max normally takes a set of things and just returns one the biggest of them, whereas the softmax is taking a set of numbers and scaling them, that is returning the whole probability distribution.
OK, so now we have all the pieces of our model.
And so how do we make our word vectors? Well, the idea of what we want to do is we want to fiddle our word vectors in such a way that we minimize our loss, i.e.
that we maximize the probability of the words we actually saw in the context of the center word.
And so the theta represents all of our model parameters in one very long vector.
So for our model here, the only parameters are our word vectors.
So we have for each word two vectors, its context vector and its center vector.
And each of those is a D dimensional vector, where D might be 300 and we have V many words.
So we end up with this big huge vector which is 2DV long, which if you have a 500,000 vocab times the 300 dimensional at the time, it's more math than I can do in my head, but it's got millions of millions of parameters, it's got millions and millions of parameters.","1.

3128,4dj1ogUwTEM,mit_cs,"Take the contrapositive of that lemma, and you can say that if a set A is uncountable and there is a surjection from C to A, then C has to be uncountable.
That's just the contrapositive of the previous one.
If C was countable, then A would be countable.
So if A is uncountable, C must be uncountable.
So this gives us, again, a nice general way to prove uncountability of sets, once I have a couple in my repertoire.
Well, it means that we could have deduced that 0, 1 to the omega, that the infinite binary sequences were uncountable, because we know that there's is a bijection between the infinite binary sequences and the power set of N.
We described that bijection without knowing anything about any other properties of the infinite binary sequences in the power set of N, whether they were countable or not.
But now that Cantor's theorem tells us that the power set of N is uncountable and there's a bijection, the previous lemma says, in particular, there's a surjection from 0, 1 to omega to the power set of N, which means 0, 1 to the omega is uncountable.
So what I'm illustrating then is that the proof that we used directly by a diagonal argument to figure out that 0, 1 to the omega was uncountable, it's really a special case of the more general diagonal argument that we used to prove Cantor's theorem.
And we get that 0, 1 to the omega is uncountable as a consequence of Cantor's theorem about the power set of N.","1. What is Cantor's Theorem and how does it relate to the concept of uncountability?

Y is bigger than everything.

If it's the negative integers, it's false because there's no biggest negative integer.
If it's the negative reals, it's false because there's no biggest negative real.

Which means the probability that it's within 2 sigma, that the actual number of measured pairs is within 2 sigma of the expected number 16.4 is greater than 1 minus 1/4, or 3/4.
There's a 3/4 chance that the number of pairs that we find is within 2 sigma of the expected number 16.4.

4863,FkfsmwAtDdY,mit_cs,"Which means that R of Jason is that set of two courses that he's associated with or that are associated with him-- that he's registered 6.042 and 6.012.
So at this point, we've applied R to one domain element-- one student Jason.
But the interesting case is when you apply R to a bunch of students.
So the general setup is that if x is a set of students-- a subset of the domain, which we've been showing in green-- then if I apply R to X, it gives me all the subjects that they're taking among them-- all the subjects that any one of them is taking.
Let's take a look at an example.
Well, another way to say it I guess is that R of X is everything in R that relates to things in X.
So if I look at Jason and Yihui and I want to know what do they connect to under R-- these are the subjects that Jason or Yihui is registered for.
The way I'd find that is by looking at the arrow diagram, and I'd find that Jason is taking 042 and 012.
And Yihui is taking 012 and 004.
So between them, they're taking three courses.
So R of Jason, Yihui is in fact 042, 012, and 004.
So another way to understand this idea of the image of a set R of X is that X is a set of points in the set that you're starting with called the domain.
And R of X is going to be all of the endpoints in the other set, the codomain, that start at X.
If I said that as a statement in formal logic or in set theory with logical notation, I would say that R of X is the set of j in subjects such that there is a d in X such that dRj.
So what that's exactly saying that dRj says that d is the starting point in the domain.
d is a student.
j is a subject.
dRj means there's an arrow that goes from student d to subject j.
And we're collecting the set of those j's that started some d.
So an arrow from X goes to j is what exists at d an X.
dRj means-- written in logic notation-- it's really talking about the endpoints of arrows, and that's a nice way to think about it.","1. What is the definition of a relation in set theory?

Suppose that I tell you that there is a 1 in [? 10,000ths ?] chance that in any given hour, the Mir is going to crash into some debris that's out there in orbit.
So the expectation of f is 10 to the fourth, about 10,000 hours.

And we're going to define an approximation ratio, row of n, for any input-- if for any input-- excuse me.
The algorithm produces a solution with cost C that satisfies this little property, which says that the max of C divided by Copt divided by-- oh, sorry-- and Copt divided by C is less than or equal to row n.
And the only reason you have two terms in here is because you haven't said whether it's a minimization problem or a maximization problem.
Right, so of it' a minimization problem, you don't want to be too much greater than the minimum.
If it's a maximization problem, you don't want to be too much smaller than the maximum.
And so you just stick those two things in there.
And you don't worry about whether it's min or max in terms of the objective function, and you want it to be a particular ratio.

So this could be a constant or it could be a function of no.
If it's a function of n, it's going to be an increasing function of n.
OK? Otherwise you could just bound it, and have a constant, obviously.
So, you might have something like-- and we'll see one of these-- log n approximation scheme, which says that you're going to be within logarithmic of the answer-- the minimum or maximum.

They're all equally probable.
So if I plotted those, I'd basically just get a straight line with everything at 1 over however many pockets there are.
So in that case, why does the empirical rule work? We saw that we were doing some estimates about returns and we used the empirical rule, we checked it and, by George, it was telling us the truth.

But what's the point of this data structure in the first place? The point is that I want to be able to potentially add a lot of things to this thing.
Does that make sense? Amortization is saying that, even though sometimes this operation will be bad, averaged over many operations, this is going to have a better running time.
That's the amortization.
So more formally, what that's going to say is, if I have an operation, the definition of it running in amortized some amount of time-- say K time or-- yeah, sure-- that means that, if I do n operations, generally for large N-- if I do that operation n times, the total time it takes me to do all of those operations is not going to be more than n times K.
So on average, it's going to take me K time.
Now, in O-4-6 you'll get a more formal definition of that and you'll get a lot of ways of analyzing things, like a potential function and-- we're going to use in what we call charging arguments even today.
So it's a much broader analysis paradigm than what we're going to talk about.
We're only going to talk about it for this material with dynamic arrays, and we'll just kind of-- it's just kind of an introduction to that.

JASON KU: Amortized as a financial term, if you know from financial term, means over the long term, this is what it is on average.
You can think about-- but that's different than running time.
That's average running time of an algorithm.
It's a much different concept.
What is an average running time? Well, that's hard to define, because it's talking about an average over all possible inputs, and then-- OK, so maybe some inputs are more likely than others, and so you've got a distribution on the inputs and you're trying to average the running time of-- this has nothing to do with that.
Amortization means that you have a-- usually a data structure that you're operating on, and you're doing an operation multiple times, and you're getting a benefit because you're doing that operation lots of times.

Let's say y was the key that was inserted, so we started with x z, which was a 3 node.

948,dRIhrn8cc9w,stanford,"It's saying, ""I don't need to do that."" Previously, I computed what it would be like if I started say in this state and continued on for the future.
And so, I, now I already know what the value is at that state, and I'm gonna bootstrap and use that as a substitute for actually doing all that roll-out.
And also here, because I know what the expected discounted or I know what the, um, sorry, the model is, that it can also just take a direct expectation over s prime.
So, my question is, is there an implicit assumption here that the reward at a given state and thus the value function of evaluated states doesn't change over time.
So, like because you're using it from the prior iteration? So, I think that question is saying, um, is there an explicit assumption here that the value doesn't change over time? Yes.
The idea in this case is that the value that we're computing is for the infinite horizon case and therefore that it's stationary.
It doesn't depend on the time step.
From that way we're not gonna talk very much about the finite horizon case today, in that case it's different.
In this situation, we're saying at all time steps you always have an infinite number more time steps to go.
So, the value function itself is a stationary quantity.
So, why is this an okay thing to do like we're bootstrapping? Um, the reason that this is okay is because we actually have an exact representation of this V_k minus one.
You're not getting any approximation error of putting that in instead of sort of explicitly summing over lots of different histories.

Great.
I'm not always that lucky.
If e is not in the list, then it will go through this entire loop until it gets all the way through the elements of L before saying false.

That was a surprise.
Another surprise of a similar kind, also about knowledge, is that the relationship between the method to be used, and the characteristics of the problem, was almost a diagonal table.

And you proved this in 6006 but you assumed something called simple uniform hashing.
Simple uniform hashing is an assumption, I think invented for CLRS.
It makes the analysis very simple, but it's also basically cheating.
So today our goal is to not cheat.
It's nice as a warm up.
But we don't like cheating.
So you may recall the assumption is about the hash function.
You want a good hash function.
And good means this.
I want the probability of two distinct keys mapping to the same slot to be 1/m if there are m slots.
If everything was completely random, if h was basically choosing a random number for every key, then that's what we would expect to happen.
So this is like the idealized scenario.
Now, we can't have a hash function could choosing a random number for every key because it has to choose the same value if you give it the same key.
So it has to be some kind of deterministic strategy or at least repeatable strategy where if you plug in the same key you get the same thing.
So really what this assumption is saying is that the key's that you give are in some sense random.
If I give you random keys and I have not-too-crazy hash function then this will be true.
But I don't like assuming anything about the keys maybe.
I want my keys to be worst case maybe.
There are lots of examples in the real world where you apply some hash function and it turns out your data has some very particular structure.
And if you choose a bad hash function, then your hash table gets really, really slow.
Maybe everything hashes to the same slot.
Or say you take-- well yeah, there are lots of examples of that.
We want to avoid that.

All right.
So the notion here is that you don't have to make a lot of stops if you know you have to go far.

We just do it at the xk's.
That's what we're told for a and for b, and so to compute c of xk it's just the sum or the product of yk and zk.

We're also going to use this view because, as we'll see, there's a problem.
Addition is easy, multiplication is easy, evaluation is annoying.
I can evaluate a of x at xk for any k, but I can't evaluate it at some arbitrary value of x.
That's annoying.
I'm told at these finite sample points, but now I have to somehow interpolate.
This is called polynomial interpolation, well studied in numerical analysis and so on.
You can do it, but it takes quadratic time, in general.
The best known algorithms are quadratic.
So, this is bad, this is bad, and this is bad, so no representation is perfect.
Life sucks.
What we'd like is to get the best-- now this one is really hard to work with because converting inter roots is impossible in an arithmetic model, so we're going to focus on column A and column C.
We kind of like to take the min of those two columns.
We won't quite get that.

You also have to have something called overlapping subproblems.
This is why the memo worked.
Finding an optimal solution has to involve solving the same problem multiple times.
Even if you have optimal substructure, if you don't see the same problem more than once-- creating a memo.
Well, it'll work, you can still create the memo.
You'll just never find anything in it when you look things up because you're solving each problem once.

In some sense, merge sort worked that way-- we were combining separate problems.
Did merge sort have overlapping subproblems? No, because-- well, I guess, it might have if the list had the same element many, many times.
But we would expect, mostly not.
Because each time we're solving a different problem, because we have different lists that we're now sorting and merging.
So it has half of it but not the other.
Dynamic programming will not help us for sorting, cannot be used to improve merge sort.
Oh, well, nothing is a silver bullet.

You have n square entries that you need to compute corresponding to the output matrix C.
And you're going to do order n multiplications and additions, but we're really going to consider multiplications here.
When I talk about n here, it's not the total number of operations.
It's the number of multiplications.
And the reason for that is-- this may have gone away a little bit, but it's still probably true-- that multiplication, in computers, it takes longer to multiply two numbers, integers are floating point numbers, than adding numbers.
It used to be much more dramatic, the differences between multiplying and add in computers.
But thanks to pipelining and lots of optimizations, multiplies are actually very fast.
But they are, obviously, a more sophisticated operation than addition.
So we'll be counting multiplies.
So when you've seen Karatsuba divide and conquer for multiply, back end in 006.
Remember that we were counting multiplications, and we were actually trading off multiplications for additions.
We were trying to shrink that number associated with the complexity of the algorithm when counting the number of multiplies.
And we actually counted the number of additions that were going up-- at least from a constant factor standpoint, not necessarily from an asymptotic complexity standpoint.
And so that's simple algorithm.
You probably heard of Strassen.
Some of you might have seen it.

3206,GqmQg-cszw4,mit_cs,"Yeah? AUDIENCE: Still going to overwrite [INAUDIBLE] as a return value.
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
So that's actually clever, right? So this is the stack frame for redirect.
I guess it actually spans all the way up here.
But what actually happens when you call getS() is that redirect makes a function call.
It actually saves its return address up here on the stack.
And then getS() starts running.
And getS() puts its own saved EBP up here.
And getS() is going to post its own variables higher up.
And then getS() is going to fill in the buffer.
So this is still problematic.
Basically, the buffer is surrounded by return initials on all sides.
Either way, you're going to be able to overflow something.
So at what point-- suppose we had a stack growing up machine.
At what point would you be able to take control of the program's execution then? Yes, and that is actually even easier in some ways.
You don't have to wait until redirect returns.
And maybe there was like, stuff that was going to mess you up like this A to i.
No.
It's actually easier, because getS() is going to overflow the buffer.
It's going to change the return address and then immediately return and immediately jump to wherever you sort of tried to construct, makes sense.

And we'll go over these in subsequent lectures.
But in principle, you could have the return address here that you override on either the stack up or stack down machine.

One place is we're promising-- we're requesting that the longest increasing subsequence starts at i, so then the question is, well, what is the very second item that's in the longest increasing subsequence that starts with i?

Instead of just taking a step in every direction, what we're going to do is we're going to take some partial derivatives.

Suppose we sort of get rid of our non-linearity and just assume that it's an identity function.
OK, so then when we're working out the partials of the hidden state with respect to the previous hidden state, we can work those out in the usual way according to the chain rule.
And then, if sigma is simply the identity function, well then, everything gets really easy for us.
So only-- the sigma just goes away.
And only the first term involves h at time t minus 1.
So the later terms go away.
And so our gradient ends up as Wh.

What happens when you want to work out these partials a number of time steps away? So we want to work it out, the partial of time step i with respect to j.
Well, what we end up with is a product of the partials of successive time steps.
And well, each of those is coming out as Wh and so we end up getting Wh raised to the l-th power.

And so to run this simulation, typically what we're doing here is I'm giving you the goal-- for example, are we going to get five 1's-- the number of trials-- each trial, in this case, will be say of length 5-- so I'm going to roll the same die five times say 1,000 different times, and then just some text as to what I'm going to print.

This is the problem statement versus the data structure is how you actually solve it.

Each item has a key.
And normally you'd think of there also being a value like in Python.

We want to be able to insert an item, delete an item, and search for an item.
But search is going to be different from what we know from AVL trees or skip lists or even Venom [INAUDIBLE] That was a predecessor-successor search.
Here we just want to know-- sorry, your not searching for an item.
Usually you're searching for just a key-- here you just want to know is there any item with that key, and return it.
This is often called an exact search because if the key is not in there, you learn absolutely nothing.
You can't find the nearest key.
And for whatever reason this is called a dictionary problem though it's unlike a real dictionary.
Usually when you search for a word you do find its neighbors.
Here we're just going to either-- if the key's there we find that, otherwise not.

PROFESSOR: Quick, quick recap of what we did last time.
So last time we introduced this idea of decomposition and abstraction.
And we started putting that into our programs.
And these were sort of high level concepts, and we achieved them using these concrete things called functions in our programs.
And functions allowed us to create code that was coherent, that had some structure to it, and was reusable.
OK.
And from now on in problem sets and in lectures, I'm going to be using functions a lot.
So make sure that you understand how they work and all of those details.
So today, we're going to introduce two new data types.
And they're called compound data types, because they're actually data types that are made up of other data types, particularly ints, floats, Booleans, and strings.
And actually not just these, but other data types as well.
So that's why they're called compound data types.
So we're going to look at a new data type called a tuple and a new data type called a list.
And then we're going to talk about these ideas that come about with-- specifically with lists.","1. What are tuples and lists, and how do they differ from each other?
2. Why are tuples and lists considered compound data types?

20. What additional materials can I consult to better understand the concepts of tuples, lists, and functions in Python?"
852,Rfkntma6ZUI,stanford,"So what we would like to do is for every relation type, we would like to split it between, ah, training message edges, uh, training supervision edges, validation edges, and test edges.
And then we would like to do this for every of the relation types and then kind of merge, uh, all of the message edges for the- for the training will, er, take all the training supervision edges for each separate relation type into the training supervision edges and then same for validation edges and for test edges, right? So kind of the point is that we wanna independently split edges from each relation type and then merge it together, uh, these splits.","1.

20. When is the optimal time during preprocessing to split and merge edges for knowledge graph embeddings?"
53,Sdw8_0RDZuw,mit_cs,"And at this point, I'm done.
I'm left with a set of edges called covering edges, which have the property that the only way to get from one vertex to another is going to have to be to use a covering edge to the target for vertex.
Or more precisely, the only way to get, say, from a to b is going to be to use that covering edge.
If there was any other path that went from a elsewhere and got back to b without using this edge, then it wouldn't be a covering edge anymore.
The fact that it's a covering edge means that if you broke it, there's no way anymore to get from a to b.
So that's the definition of covering edges and you'll do a class problem about them, more precisely, in a minute.
So the other edges are unneeded to define the walk relation.
And all we need to keep are the covering relations to get the minimum representation of the walk relation in terms of a DAG.

940,dRIhrn8cc9w,stanford,"So, what we're gonna get to very shortly is how do we do all of that when we don't get a model of the world in advance.
But, let's just first a recap, um, sort of this general problem of policy evaluation.
So, we heard a little bit about policy evaluation last time when we talked about policy evaluation as being one step inside a policy, um, iteration which alternated between policy evaluation and policy improvement.
So, the idea in policy evaluation is somebody gives you a way to act and then you want to figure out how good that policy is.","1. What is model-free policy evaluation in the context of reinforcement learning?

It turns out in analyzing that with high probability would be even more painful than the painful analysis we're going to do.
So we won't go there.
And then we walk down to the bottom list.
And the bottom list we'll call L0.
And walk right in L0 until the element is found or not.
And you know that if you've overshot.
So if you're looking here for route 67, when you get to 72 here-- you've seen 66 and you get to 72 and you're looking for 67, search fails.

7,1A6VoEkQnhQ,stanford,"And, uh, the reason why a, uh, uh, plain GNN cannot differentiate between, you know, node 1 in, uh, a cycle of length 3 versus a cycle of leng- length 4 is that if you look at the GNN computation graph, re- both- for both of these nodes V_1 and V_2, the computation graph is exactly the same.

Uh, unless, right, you have some way to discriminate nodes based on the features.

1406,_PwhiWxHK8o,mit_cs,"And now, we've got to have a summation over all the constraints.
And each or those constraints is going to have a multiplier, alpha sub i.
And then, we write down the constraint.
And when we write down a constraint, there it is up there.
And I've got to be hyper careful here, because, otherwise, I'll get lost in the algebra.
So the constraint is y sub i times vector, w, dotted with vector x sub i plus b, and now, I've got a closing parenthesis, a minus 1.
That's the end of my constraint, like so.
I sure hope I've got that right, because I'll be in deep trouble if that's wrong.
Anybody see any bugs in that? That looks right.
doesn't it? We've got the original thing we're trying to work with.
Now, we've got Lagrange multipliers all multiplied.
It's back to that constraint up there, where each constraint is constrained to be 0.
Well, there's a little bit of mathematical slight of hand here, because in the end, the ones that are going to be 0, the Lagrange multipliers here.
The ones that are going to be non 0 are going to be the ones connected with vectors that lie in the gutter.
The rest are going to be 0.

I'll choose another one.
OK.
I think I forgot to mention one thing that's important.
So you may ask why do I care? Why do I care about that worst case? What's the chance of it happening in practice? It's very low, but in algorithms, we really don't like making assumptions on inputs.
Why? Because if you imagine you're running, say, a website, a web server, and you code has some has table in it.
So if your competitor, or someone who hates you, wants to put you out of business, and if he knows your hash function, he can create a worst case input.
That will make your website infinitely slow.
So what we are saying here is I don't tell him what hash function I'll use.
I'll say I choose one.
If he figures out the wrong input, the worst case input, I'm going to change my hash function and use another one.
Make sense? Now the definition of universal hash function is that if I pick a random h from my universal hash function family, the probability that any key i mapped to the same bin as any key j should be less or equal than 1 over m, where m is my hash table.
This is really the best you can get.
If the hash function is really evenly distributing things, you should get this property.
So we have seen one universal hash function in the class.
I'll just go over the other example, which is ak plus b modulo p, and then modulo m.
So p is a prime number that is greater than the universe size.

And you say, oops.
You say, aren't those just a rotational variance of each other? And the answer is sure.
I write them all down, because if you get a fork-style junction in space, there are three different ways it could be labeled.
Depending on which of the lines you put the minus label on.
So that takes care of that.
And then there's one more of these fork-style junctions.
And that's plus, plus, minus that derives from this case.
And there appear to be three more of these L-style junctions.

3487,2P-yW7LQr08,mit_cs,"So it turns out everything that we've done kind of extrapolates very well to identical machines, even though there's many identical machines.
But if you have non-identical machines, what that means is you have resources or machines that have different types.
So maybe your machines are T1 to Tm.
And it's essentially a situation where you say, this particular task can only be run on this machine or this other machines, some subset of machines.
So you can still have a weight of 1 for all requests, but you have something like A of i belonging subset of T is a set of machines that i runs on.
OK, that's it.
That's the change we make.
Q of i is going to be specified for each of the i's.
So you could even have two machines.
And you could say, here's a set of requests that could run on both machines.
Here's a set that only runs on the first machine, and here's another set that runs on the second machine.
That's a simple example of this generalization.
If you do this, this problem has been shown to be NP complete.
And by that I mean, NP complete problems are decision problems.
And so you say, can some specific number k less than and requests be scheduled.
This decision problem is NP complete.

2371,fV3v6qQ3w4A,mit_cs,"But now that I mentioned it, I expect it's a familiar idea.
And it's pretty obvious too if you think about it for a minute.
Here's a way to think about it.
Given an nonempty set of integers, you could ask, is 0 the least element in it? Well, if it is, then you're done.
Then you could say, is 1 the least element in it? And if it is, you're done.
And if it isn't, you could say 2, is 2 the least element? And so on.
Given that it's not empty, eventually you're to hit the least element.
So, if it wasn't obvious before, there is something of a hand-waving proof of it.
But I want to get you to think about this well ordering principle a little bit because it's not-- there are some technical parts of it that matter.
So for example, suppose I replace nonnegative integers by nonnegative rationals.
And I asked does every nonempty set of nonnegative rationals have a least element? Well, there is a least nonnegative rational, namely 0.
But not every nonnegative set of rationals has a least element.
I'll let you think of an example.

And if I take the max those two options, that will give-- that is my local brute force the best choice of how many-- what are the total value of coins I will get out of the remainder, given that you start, plus this coin that I took right now in the first step, and for the two possible choices of what that coin is?

So look at this.
If I say to it, why were you interested in the animal's claws? Because I was trying to see if it was a carnivore.
How did you know that the animal is a mammal? Because it has hair.
Why did you think it was a cheetah? Because it's a mammal, a carnivore, has spots, and very fast.
So by working forward and backward in this goal tree, this too can answer questions about its own behavior.
So now you know how, going forward, you can write programs that answer questions about their behavior.
Either you write the subroutines so that each one is wrapped around a goal, so you've got goal-centered programming, or you build a so-called expert system using rules, in which case it's easy to make it leave behind a trace of a goal tree, which makes it possible to answer questions about its own behavior, just as this [INAUDIBLE] program did.
But now, a little more vocabulary.
I'm going to save time by erasing all of these things that I previously drew by way of connections.
And I'm going to approach this zoo in a little different way.

Given a piece of code, you're going to reason about each chunk of code separately.

So that's order n squared.
n times n.
The combination is I have to do this work and then that work.

The fitness is a function of x and y, and it's equal to the sine of some constant times x, quantity squared, times the sine of some constant y, quantity squared, e to the plus x plus y divided by some constant.
So sigma and omega there are just in there so that it kind of makes a nice picture for demonstration.

The second specification requires randomness.
It says, it returns are randomly chosen int.
So it requires a stochastic implementation.
Let's look at how we implement a random process in Python.
We start by importing the library random.
This is not to say you can import any random library you want.
It's to say you import the library called random.
Let me get my pen out of here.
And we'll use that a lot.
And then we're going to use the function in random called random.choice.
It takes as an argument a sequence, in this case a list, and randomly chooses one member of the list.
And it chooses it uniformly.

And what that means is that it's equally probable that it will choose any number in that list each time you call it.
We'll later look at distributions that are not uniform, not equally probable, where things are weighted.

And I'm going to refer to logistic regression.
[NOISE] Right? Where uh, suppose that you run logistic regression with uh, gradient descent, say stochastic gradient descent, then you initialize the parameters to be equal to 0 at first.
And then for each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, right [NOISE] you update theta it gets updated as theta minus the learning rate times [NOISE] you know, [NOISE] times X and Y okay? And so- sorry here alpha is the learning rate, uh, nothing, this is overloaded notation, this alpha has nothing to do with that alpha.

So when you make recursive calls and you want to count the number of recursive procedure calls-- you want to do something inside each of the recursive procedures and you want to sort of cumulatively or collectively keep some information, one way of certainly doing it is to pass arguments.

It doesn't matter in what order we aggregate, we want the- the result to be always the same because it doesn't matter whether, you know, node B has neighbors A- A and C, or C and A, they are just- it's just a set of elements.

So average- so a summation, use permutation or that invariant because in any number, you sum up the- the- the numbers, in any way you sum up the numbers, you will always get the same result.
So average or a summation is a, uh, permutation invariant aggregation function.
So for example, the idea here is that every- every of these operators here will simply take the messages from the children, uh, and average node, and then decide to take this average and make a new message out of it.
So the way we can, um, do this is do the, er, we aggregate the messages and then we apply our neural network, which means we apply some linear transformation followed by a non-linearity to create a next, uh, level message.

I'm sure lots of developers worked on this.

So actually building a system that authenticates users with passwords is pretty tricky.

So if you can guess, make a million attempts at someone's account, then there's a good chance you'll get their password because people actually pick predictable passwords.

Where instead of 0 and 1 I replaced them with t and t plus 1.
Right? Um, and finally to, to- you know, the very first thing we did was let's let f of theta be equal to say L prime of theta.
Right? Because we wanna find the place where the first derivative of L is 0.
Then this becomes theta t plus 1, gets updated as theta t minus L prime of theta t over L double prime of theta t.
So it's really, uh, the first derivative divided by the second derivative.
Okay? So Newton's method is a very fast algorithm, and, uh, it has, um, Newton's method enjoys a property called quadratic convergence.
Not a great name.
Don't worry- don't worry too much about what it means.
But informally, what it means is that, um, if on one iteration Newton's method has 0.01 error, so on the X axis, you're 0.01 away from the, from the value, from the true minimum, or the true value of f is equal to 0.
Um, after one iteration, the error could go to 0.0001 error, and after two iterations it goes 0.00000001.
But roughly Newton's method, um, under certain assumptions, uh, uh, that functions move not too far from quadratic, the number of significant digits that you have converged, the minimum doubles on a single iteration.
So this is called quadratic convergence.

47,P3YoIxiz6to,mit_cs,"So in general, we have some problem A-- decision problem A and parameter k.
And we want to convert into some decision problem B with parameter k prime.
And of course, as usual, the set up is we're given an instance x.
This is going to look almost identical to NP Karp-style reductions, but then we're going to have one extra condition.
So instance x of A gets mapped to by a function f to an instance x prime of B.
X prime is f o x as usual.
This needs to be a polynomial time function just like for NP reductions, which means, in particular, x prime has polynomials size reduced back to x.
It should be answer preserving.
So x is yes instance for A if and only x prime is a yes instance for B.
So, so far, exactly NP reductions.
And then when we need one extra thing which is parameter preserving.
This is there's some function g, which I'll call the parameter blow up-- or, I guess you call it parameter growth for g-- such that the new parameter value for the converted instance is, at most, that function of the original parameter value of the original instance.
Question? AUDIENCE: Are there any limits on the amount of time that g can take to compute? PROFESSOR: g should be a computable function.
I think that's all we need.
Probably polynomial time is also a fine, but usually this is going to be like linear or polynomial or exponential.
It's rarely some insanely large thing, but computable would be nice.
Cool.
So that is our notion of parameterized reduction.
And the consequence, if this exists and B is fixed parameter tractable, then A is because we can take an instance of A converting it to B.
If the original parameter was founded by some k, this new parameter will be bounded by g of k.
New instance will be bounded of g of k.
So we run the FPT algorithm for B, and that gives us the answer to the original instance of A.
So if we don't care about what this function is, we are basically composing functions.
So there's some f dependence on k in this algorithm, and we're taking that function of g of k is our new function.
And we get a new dependence on k and the running time over FPT.
So what that means is if we believe it A does not have an FPT, then B does not have an FPT if we can do these reductions.","1. Is there a specific type of problem that fits into the category of decision problem A or B?

And I'm really happy that someone in the front row answered the question because I can throw it that far.
You store the answer and then look it up when you need it.
Because we know that we can look things up very quickly.
Dictionary, despite what Eric said in his lecture, almost all the time works in constant time if you make it big enough, and it usually is in Python.
We'll see later in the term how to do that trick.
So you store it and then you'd never have to compute it again.

1976,uXt8qF2Zzfo,mit_cs,"And we need to look at the picture.
And the reason I turned this guy around was actually because from a point of view of letting the math sing to us, this piece here is the same as this piece here.
So part of what we needed to do to calculate the partial derivative with respect to w1 has already been done when we calculated the partial derivative with respect to w2.
And not only that, if we calculated the partial wit respect to these green w's at both levels, what we would discover is that sort of repetition occurs over and over again.
And now, I'm going to try to give you an intuitive idea of what's going on here rather than just write down the math and salute it.
And here's a way to think about it from an intuitive point of view.
Whatever happens to this performance function that's back of these p's here, the stuff over there can influence p only by going through, and influence performance only going through this column of p's.
And there's a fixed number of those.
So it depends on the width, not the depth of the network.
So the influence of that stuff back there on p is going to end up going through these guys.
And it's going to end up being so that we're going to discover that a lot of what we need to compute in one column has already been computed in the column on the right.
So it isn't going to explode exponentially, because the influence-- let me say it one more time.
The influences of changes of changes in p on the performance is all we care about when we come back to this part of the network, because this stuff cannot influence the performance except by going through this column of p's.","1.

2791,C1lhuz6pZC0,mit_cs,"So essentially I'm going to use a binary number to represent the set of items I choose to take.
For item three say, if bit three is zero I'm not taking the item.
If bit three is one, then I am taking the item.
So it just shows I can now very nicely represent what I've done by a single vector of zeros and ones.
Let me pause for a second.
Does anyone have any questions about this setup? It's important to get this setup because what we're going to see now depends upon that setting in your head.
So I've kind of used mathematics to describe the backpack problem.
And that's typically the way we deal with these optimization problems.
We start with some informal description, and then we translate them into a mathematical representation.
So here it is.
We're going to try and find a vector v that maximizes the sum of V sub i times I sub i.
Now, remember I sub i is the value of the item.
V sub i is either zero or one So if I didn't take the item, I'm multiplying its value by zero.
So it contributes nothing to the sum.
If I did take the item, I'm multiplying its value by one.
So the value of the item gets added to the sum.
So that tells me the value of V.
And I want to get the most valuable V I can get subject to the constraint that if I look at the item's dot weight and multiply it by V, the sum of the weights is no greater than w.
So I'm playing the same trick with the values of multiplying each one by zero or one, and that's my constraint.
Make sense? All right, so now we have the problem formalized.
How do we solve it? Well, the most obvious solution is brute force.
I enumerate all possible combinations of items; that is to say, I generate all subsets of the items that are available-- I don't know why it says subjects here, but we should have said items.","1. Is the binary number representation the only way to represent the set of items to choose from?

Okay.
So when does this converge? So if the discount factor is less than 1 or your MDP graph is acyclic then this is going to converge.
So if MDP graph is acyclic that's kind of obvious you are just doing dynamic programming over your full-thing.
So- so that's going to- that's going to converge.
If you have cycles, you- you want your- your discounts to be less than 1.
Because if you're, if you have cycles and your discount is let's say 1 and let's say you are getting 0 rewards from, then you're never going to change.
You're never going to move, you move from your state.
You're always going to be stuck in your state.
And if you have non-zero rewards you're going to get this unbounded reward and you keep going because you have cycles and it's just going to end up becoming numerically difficult.
So just a good rule of thumb is pick a Gamma that's less than one.
Then you kind of get this convergence property.
Okay, all right, so summary so far is we have MDPs.
Now, you've talked about finding policies, rather than path, policy evaluation is just a way of computing like how good a policy is.
And the reason I talked about policy evaluation is there's this other algorithm called policy iteration which uses policy evaluation and we didn't discuss that in the class.
But it's kind of like, not equivalent but you could use it in a similar manner as value iteration.
It has its pros and cons.
So policy evaluation is used in those settings.
Do not leave please.
We have more stuff to cover.
[LAUGHTER] And then we have value iteration, uh, which, uh, computes its optimal value which is the maximum expected utility, okay? And next time, we're going to talk about reinforcement learning, and that's going to be awesome.

Because we have the choice of backing up to the place where we last made a decision and choosing another branch.
So, that process is called variously back-up or backtracking.
At this point, we would say, ah, dead end.
The first place we find when we back up the tree where we made a choice is when we chose b instead of d.
So, we go back up there and take the other route.
s, a, d now goes to g.
And we're done.
We're going to make up a little table here of things that we can embellish our basic searches with.
And one of the things we can embellish our basic searches with is this backtracking idea.
Now, backtrack is not relevant to the British Museum algorithm, because you've got to find everything.
You can't quit when you've found one path.
But you'd always want to use backtracking with Depth-first Search, because you may plunge on down and miss the path that gets to the goal.
Now, you might ask me, is backtracking, therefore, always part of Depth-first Search? And you can read textbooks that do it either way.
Count on it.
If we give you a Search problem on a quiz, we'll tell you whether or not your Search is supposed to use backtracking.
We consider it to be an optional thing.
You'd be pretty stupid not to use this optional thing when you're doing Depth-first Search.
But we'll separate these ideas out and call it an optional add-on.
so, that's Depth-first Search, very simple.
Now, the natural companion to Depth-first Search will be Breadth-first Search, Breadth-first.

4483,C6EWVBNCxsc,mit_cs,"In general, this is a world called online algorithms, which is a whole field.
I'm just going to mention it briefly here.
The distinction here is LRU, or whatever we implement in a real system, has to make a decision based only on the past of what's happened.
The system, we're assuming, doesn't know the future.
So in a compiler, maybe you could try to predict the future and do something.
But on a CPU, it doesn't know what instruction's going to come next, 10 steps in the future.
So you just have to make a decision now, sort of your best guess.
And least recently used is a good best guess.
OPT, on the other hand, we're giving a lot of power.
This is what we call an offline algorithm.
It's like the Q in Star Trek: Next Generation or some other mythical being.
It lives outside of the timeline.
It can see all of time and say, I think I'll evict this block.
This is like the waste of Q's resources.
But I'll evict this block because I know it's going to be used for this in the future.
LRU is evicting the thing that was used farthest in the past.
There's a difference there.
And it could be a big difference.
But it turns out they're related in this way.
So this is what we call an online algorithm, meaning you have to make decisions as you go.
The offline algorithm gets to see the future and optimize accordingly.
Both are computable, but this one's only computable if you know the future, which we don't.
What I haven't done is prove this theorem.","1. Is LRU (Least Recently Used) the only heuristic used for online algorithms in cache management?

1681,iTMn0Kt18tg,mit_cs,"This is why.
This is obvious just from regular algebra.
And then this thing, Euler's formula, tells me that corresponds to doubling the angle on a circle.
So it only works with points on a circle.
So when I go here I get e to the i2k times tau over n-- twice as far around circle.
All right.
Fine.
What happens if I take this number and I square it? This has a really big angle.
This is 1/2 plus 1/8, whatever that is-- 5/8 times tau.
When I double that angle I go to here.
Now, this, you might call it, 10/8, or you might also call it 1/4 because when you go around the circle you stay on the circle.
So there's another thing going on, which is really-- this is e to the i times 2 theta mod tau.
Usually we think of mods relative to integers, but what I mean is every time I add a multiple of tau nothing changes.
If I go around the circle five times and then do something, it's the same as just doing the something.
So I kind of need that.
And this is true because e to the i tau equals 1.
You may know it as e to the i pi equals negative 1, but clearly this is a superior formula-- so superior I got it tattooed on my other arm.

So overall what this shows is that arithmetic modulo n is a lot like ordinary arithmetic.

That is, in the remainder range from 0 to n minus 1.
And we use this standard closed open interval notation to mean the interval from 0 to n.
So it's sometimes used in analysis to mean the real interval of reals.

So what is the cost of C, if you know your minimum spanning tree? STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: No.
So you're traversing every edge in the minimum spanning tree twice.
So you're doing a DFS traversal, right? So you're going down, and you're coming back up.

Does that make sense, why the traversal implies that you have every edge being visited twice, right? OK.

I guess now we all do know that we live in Boston.
And I should say, I hope none of you were affected too much by the fire yesterday in Cambridge, but that seems to have been a pretty disastrous event for some.
Anyway, here's the reading.
This is a chapter in the book on clustering, a topic that Professor Grimson introduced last week.
And I'm going to try and finish up with respect to this course today, though not with respect to everything there is to know about clustering.
Quickly just reviewing where we were.
We're in the unit of a course on machine learning, and we always follow the same paradigm.
We observe some set of examples, which we call the training data.
We try and infer something about the process that created those examples.
And then we use inference techniques, different kinds of techniques, to make predictions about previously unseen data.
We call that the test data.
As Professor Grimson said, you can think of two broad classes.
Supervised, where we have a set of examples and some label associated with the example-- Democrat, Republican, smart, dumb, whatever you want to associate with them-- and then we try and infer the labels.","1. Is the content provided by MIT OpenCourseWare completely free to access?

And now u is in S, v is not in S.
So if you look at that path, for a while, you might stay in S, but eventually you have to leave S, which means there has to be an edge like this one, which I'll call it e prime, which transitions from S to V minus S.
So there must be an edge e prime in the minimum spanning tree that crosses the cut, because u and v are connected by a path and that path starts in S, ends not in S, so it's got to transition at least once.

2533,MjbuarJ7SE0,mit_cs,"So decomposition is really just the problem of creating structure in your code.
In the projector example, we have separate devices working together.
In programming, to achieve decomposition you're dividing your code into smaller modules.
These are going to be self-contained, and you can think of them as sort of little mini-programs.
You feed in some input to them, they do a little task, and then they give you something back.
They go off and do their thing and then they give back a result.
These modules can be used to break up your code, and the important thing is that they're reusable.
So you write a module once-- a little piece of code that does something once-- you debug it once, and then you can reuse it many, many times in your code with different inputs.","1. Is decomposition in programming similar to breaking down tasks in project management?

And remember, what does predecessor and successor mean? It's talking about an implicit order in the tree, which is what we call traversal order, which is defined recursively as recursively traverse the left subtree, then output the root, then recursively traverse the right subtree.

The program might do something different than what you expected it to do.
And that's not because the program suddenly-- for example, you expected the program to give you an output of 0 for a certain test case, and the output that you got was 10.
Well, the program didn't suddenly decide to change its answer to 10.
It just executed the program that you wrote.
That's the case where the program gave you a different answer than expected.
Programs might crash, which means they stop running.
That's OK.
Just go back to your code and figure out what was wrong.
And another example of a different meaning than what you intended was maybe the program won't stop.
It's also OK.
There are ways to stop it besides restarting the computer.
So then Python programs are going to be sequences of definitions and commands.
We're going to have expressions that are going to be evaluated and commands that tell the interpreter to do something.

Or you can type commands up in here, on the left-hand side, and then run your program.
Notice that, well, we'll talk about this-- I won't talk about this now.
But these are-- on the right-hand side, typically, you write very simple commands just if you're testing something out.
And on the left-hand side here in the editor, you write more lines and more complicated programs.

There are m equal theta and secondary tables.
There's a slight question of how big are the secondary tables.
If one of these tables is like linear size, then I have to spend linear time for a trial.
And then I multiply that by the number of trials and also the number of different things that would be like n squared log n n.
But you know a secondary table better not have linear sides.

That all the li's are pretty small.

Why not? Because if we have a subproblem, say, compatible set of l i and w i, and if we go from here, and choose the next block, say t, it's guaranteed that t is shorter and narrower.

Now Tessa could either pick V2 or she could pick Vn.
In that case, Josiah, who's the first player, could pick V3 or Vn minus 1 and stick with his rule of picking the odd coins.

During optimization the user first experiences one control law while respiratory measurements are taken.
Steady-state energy cost is estimated by fitting a first-order dynamical model to two minutes of transient data.

All right, so let's see what happens.
If we run the experiment on these three distributions, each of 100,000 point examples, and look at different sample sizes, we actually see that the difference between the standard deviation and the sample standard deviation of the population standard deviation is not the same.
We see, down here-- this looks kind of like what we saw before.
But the exponential one is really quite different.
You know, its worst case is up here at 25.
The normal is about 14.
So that's not too surprising, since our temperatures were kind of normally distributed when we looked at it.

Should that surprise us, or is there a reason we should have expected that to happen? Well, what's the answer? Someone tell me why we should have expected it.

So, if you only take the same you know one action in a state, you can't really learn about any other, um, actions you would take.
So, you need to assume some sort of generalization or some sort of stochasticity in your policy in order for that information to be useful to try to evaluate other policies.

759,ptuGllU5SQQ,stanford,"Do we need to even try to compute all pairs of interactions if we can do sort of a bunch of other stuff that's going to be more efficient to compute? So, like looking at local windows.
We know that's useful, but not sufficient in some sense.
Looking at everything.
So, if you were to just take an average of vectors, just all the averaging of vectors, you don't need to compute interactions for that.
And if you look sort of at random pairs, you don't need to take all that much time to compute that as well.
And so, what this paper did is they did all of them.
So you have random attention, you have a word window attention where you're looking at your local neighbors, and you have sort of global attention where you're sort of attending without interacting with stuff, attending broadly over the whole sequence.
You do a whole bunch of it, right, and you end up being able to approximate a lot of good things.
These are not necessarily the answer.
The normal transformer variant is by far the most popular, currently.
But it's a fascinating question to look into.

2875,VYZGlgzr_As,mit_cs,"So we're going to have distinguished vertices, two distinguished vertices.
And we're going to call them the source, s, and a sink, t.
And so the basic idea here-- and just to sort of set things up right up front-- is that there's going to be some flow coming out of s.
And it's going to have to obey some constraints associated with capacities of the edges, in order to make its way to t.
And along the way-- this is flow.
This is water.
You can think of it as water, or cars, or what have you.
It's a rate.
You're not going to allow accumulation in the intermediate nodes.
So you're going to have law of conservation associated with this commodity that's flowing, be water, or cars, or people.
And that essentially comes down to, for any vertex, other than s or t, everything entering the vertex has to leave the vertex.
So that's like Kirchoff's current law, for example.
So there's a lot of analogies here with respect to real life, or electricity in this case.
And you'll see that, I think, over and over as we go along.
So let's take a look at a flow network.

Except that what these functions do is they take in the list, and they modify it.
But as functions, they obviously return something back to whoever called them.
And oftentimes, they're going to return the value none.

1513,SE4P7IVCunE,mit_cs,"I wrote this code a couple of years ago.
And it was my attempt at creating robot cheerleaders , because I needed some motivation.
And then I googled, last night, ""robot cheerleaders,"" and was not disappointed.
Created this GIF.
It looks pretty cool.
And it looks like they kind of stole my idea.
But that's fine.
So let's look at what this code's supposed to do.
I'm going to run it.
I'm going to run it, and then we'll go through it.
All right, it prints out, ""I will cheer for you! Enter a word."" You know what, I like robots, so I'll put in ""ROBOTS."" How enthusiastic am I about robots? Let's say 6.
So what this is going to print is-- it's a cheerleader, right? ""Give me an r, r."" ""Give me an o, o."" ""Give me a b, b,"" and so on and so on.
""What does that spell? ROBOTS."" And it's going to print it 6 times, because I'm 6 out of 10 enthusiastic about robots.
So that's pretty much what that code's supposed to do.
And you can write it using what we've learned so far.
Now let's go through it a little bit.
And I'm going to show you just how easy it is to convert this code using a for loop over characters.
Right now, what it does is it asks the user for input, so a word and a number.
And then it does this thing, here, right? First, it uses a while loop.
And second, it uses indexing.
And what tips you off that it's using indexing is it's using the square bracket, here, into the word.
And obviously, it's using a while loop.
And it has to first create a counter, initialize it.
And then, down here, it's going to increment it inside the while loop.
If you remember, that's sort of what we need to do for while loops.
So it's going to start at 0, and it's just basically going to go through index i is equal to 0, 1, 2, 3 4, which is going to go all the way to the end of the word, whatever the user typed in, in this case ""ROBOTS.""

OK? So we're looking at drawings.
And those coordinates over there are the two-dimensional coordinates in the drawing.
Just as if it were on your retina.
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] vertexes on the 3D projection or can curved surfaces also? PATRICK WINSTON: So he asked about curved surfaces.
And the answer is that you have to find corresponding points on the object.
So if you have a totally curved surface and you can't identify any corresponding points, you lose.
But if you consider our faces, there are some obvious points, even though our face are not by any means flat like these objects.","1. Is orthographic projection commonly used in visual object recognition?

And therefore those two numbers are congruent.
It's very easy to tell when two numbers are congruent mod 10 because they just have the same lower digit.

Another way to understand congruency and what it's really all about is the so-called remainder lemma, which sets that a is congruent to b mod n, if and only if a and b have the same remainder on division by n.
So let's work with that definition.

This is a very common kind of scaling called z-scaling.
The other way people scale is interpolate.
They take the smallest value and call it 0, the biggest value, they call it 1, and then they do a linear interpolation of all the values between 0 and 1.
So the range is 0 to 1.
That's also very common.
So this is a general way to get all of the features sort of in the same ballpark so that we can compare them.

4470,MEz1J9wY2iM,mit_cs,"Right? Epsilon would then be at 2 approximation, 1 divided by-- this would be one half.
And so 1 over epsilon is 2.
So then you've got your trivial algorithm that we had, the 2 approximation scheme.
So that makes sense? So the second phase is you're going to start with your seed corresponding to A and B.
You're going to set them to A prime and B prime.
And what I'm going to do is, for I equals m plus 1 to n, if w(a) less than or equal to w(b), A equals A union I-- running out of room-- else B equals B union I.
OK? So it's not that hard to see, hopefully.
All I'm doing here is, I'm just going in a very greedy way.
I got my initial A prime and B prime.
I set them to A and B.
And I say, oh, I got this element here.
Which one is bigger? This one is bigger? I'm going to put the element over here.
And then I look at it again.
I got another element.
Which one is bigger? And I go this way, that way.

We will assume that the a has unique elements.

So the recurrence, once you do that, is t of n equals-- we're going to just say it's order one for n less than or equal to 140.
Where did that come from? Well, like 140.
It's just a large number.
It came from the fact that you're going to see 10 minus 3, which is 7.
And then you want to multiply that by 2.
So some reasonably large number-- we're going to go off and we're going to assume that's a constant.
So you could sort those 140 numbers and find the median or whatever rank.
It's all constant time once you get down to the base case.

In particular, we'll talk about something that we'll call a state machine.
A state machine is a thing that works in steps.
On every step, the state machine gets a new input.
Then, based on that input and its memory of what's come before, the state machine decides to do something.
It generates an output.
And then, the process repeats.

I'll say a lot more about that today.
So the idea will be that once you've composed a state machine, you'll be able to join two state machines and have its behavior look just like one state machine.
That's a way to get a more complicated behavior by constructing two simpler behaviors.

We want to learn tools that let us compose complex behaviors out of simple behaviors.

All right.
Now, in actual clinical practice, you might wonder, can this ever hold? Because there are clinical guidelines.
Well, a couple of places where you'll see this are as follows.
First, often, there are settings where we haven't the faintest idea how to treat patients, like second line diabetes treatments.
You know that the first thing we start with is metformin.
But if metformin doesn't help control the patient's glucose values, there are several second line diabetic treatments.
And right now, we don't really know which one to try.
So a clinician might start with treatments from one class.
And if that's not working, you try a different class, and so on.
And it's a bit random which class you start with for any one patient.
In other settings, there might be good clinical guidelines, but there is randomness in other ways.
For example, clinicians who are trained on the west coast might be trained that this is the right way to do things, and clinicians who are trained in the east coast might be trained that this is the right way to do things.
And so even if any one clinician's treatment decisions are deterministic in some way, you'll see some stochasticity now across clinicians.","1. What is the assumption mentioned that, if violated, invalidates conclusions from data?

Don't get started at 7:00 PM when we have 11:59 PM deadline on Thursday, all right? That four hours or five hours of time may not be enough to go from magical to obvious, OK? So let's get started with the paradigm associated with divide and conquer.
It's just a beautiful notion that you can break up the problem into smaller parts and somehow compose the solutions to the smaller parts.
And of course, the details are going to be what's important when we take a particular problem instance.
But let's say we're given a problem of size n.
We're going to divide it into a sub problems-- I'll put that in quotes so you know it's a symbol-- a sub problems of size n over b.
And here, a is an integer.
And a is going to be greater than or equal to 1.
It could be two.
It could be three.
It could be four.
This is the generalization I alluded to.
And b does not have to be two or even an integer.
But it has to be strictly greater than one.
Otherwise, there's no notion of divide and conquer.
You're not breaking things up into smaller problems.
So b should be strictly greater than one.
So that's the general setting.
And then you'll solve each sub problem recursively.
And the idea here is that once the sub problems become really small, they become constant size, it's relatively easy to solve them.
You can just do exhaustive search.
If you have 10 elements and you're doing effectively a cubic search, well, 10 cubed is 1,000.
That's a constant.
You're in great shape as long as the constants are small enough.

And they're going to take advantage of this mutability concept.
So we can add elements directly to the end of the list using this funky looking notation L.append.
And then the element we want to add to the end.
And this operation mutates the list.
So if I have L is equal to 2, 1, 3, and I append the element 5 to the end, then L-- the same L is going to point to the same object, except it's going to have an extra number at the end.

p1.speak() just says ""hello."" And then, the age difference between p1 and p2 is just 5.
So that's just subtracting and then printing that out to the screen.
OK, so that's my person.
Let's add another class.
This class is going to be a student, and it's going to be a subclass of Person.
Since it's a subclass of Person, it's going to-- a student is going inherit all the attributes of a person, and therefore, all the attributes of an animal.
The __init__ method of a student is going to be a little different from the one of Person.
We're going to give it a name, an age, and a major.
Notice we're using default arguments here.
So if I create a student without giving it a major, the major is going to be set to None originally.
Once again, this line here, Person.
init (self, name, age), tells Python, hey, you already know how to initialize a person for me with this name and this age.
So can you just do that? And Python says, yes, I can do that for you.
And so that saves you, maybe, like five lines of code just by calling the __init__ method that you've already written through Person, OK? So Student has been initialized to be a person.
And additionally, we're going to set another data attribute for the student to be the major.
And we're going to set the major to be None.
The student is going to get this setter here, this setter method, which is going to change the major to whatever else they want if they want to change it.
And then, I'm going to override the speak() method.
So the speak method for the person, recall, just said ""hello."" A student is going to be a little bit more complex.

So normally you run programs and wr- write programs with the intention of running them and do, do something useful.

Uh, if you want to define some distribution, can you just, uh, can you find like hard-code the table instead of doing this.

Um, with probability Alpha, i set X_i equals X_i minus 1 plus 1, 0, so I'm going to the right, and with probability 1 minus Alpha I'm going down.

2686,kHyNqSnzP8Y,mit_cs,"PATRICK WINSTON: I'm always using the individuals that have already been selected at every step, so every step is a little different because it's working with a new set of individuals that have already been selected for the next generation.
OK? So let's see how this works.
So this is showing the evolution of some swimming creatures.
And they're evolved according to how well they can swim, how fast they can go.
Some of them have quite exotic mechanisms, and some of them quite natural.
That looked like a sperm cell floating away there.
Once you have these things evolving, then of course, you can get groups of them to evolve together.
So you saw already some that were evolving to swim.
These are evolving to move around on the land.
It's interesting-- this was done by Karl Sims, who at the time was at a then thriving company, Thinking Machines, a fresh spinoff from MIT.
So he was using a vastly parallel computer, super powerful for its day, thousands of processors, to do this.
And it was a demonstration of what you could do with lots of computing.
In the early stages of the experimentation, though, its notion of physics wasn't quite complete, so some of the creatures evolved to move by hitting themselves in the chest and not knowing about the conservation of momentum.","1.

So given the data set, how would you like to estimate theta? Well, one natural way to choose theta is to choose whatever value of theta has a highest likelihood.
Or in other words, choose a value of theta so that that value of theta maximizes the probability of the data, right? And so, um, for- to simplify the algebra rather than maximizing the likelihood capital L is actually easier to maximize the log likelihood.

2339,tKwnms5iRBU,mit_cs,"The worry, I guess, is that things become disconnected when you do that, but that's essentially not going to happen because if I think of removing e prime, again, that disconnects the tree into two parts.
And I know, by this path, that one part contains this vertex, another part contains this vertex, and I know that this vertex is connected to u and this vertex is connected to v.
Maybe I should call this u prime and v prime.
I know u and u prime are connected by a path.
I know v and v prime are connected by a path.
But I know that by deleting e prime, u prime and v prime are not connected to each other.
Therefore, u and v are not connected to each other, after removing e prime.
So when I add in e, I newly connect u and v again, and so everything's connected back together.
I have exactly the right number of edges.
Therefore, I'm a spanning tree.
So that's the graph three theory part.
Now the interesting part from a greedy algorithm is to prove to this is minimum, that the weight is not too big.
So let's do that over here.
So I have the weight of T star minus e plus-- minus e prime plus e.
By linearity, this is just the weight of T star minus the weight e prime plus the weight of e.
And now we're going to use this property, we haven't that yet, e is a least-weight edge crossing the cut.
So e prime crosses the cut, so does e, but e is the smallest possible weight you could have crossing the cut.
That means that-- I'll put that over here-- the weight of e is less than or equal to the weight of e prime, because e prime is a particular edge crossing the cut, e was the smallest weight of them.
So that tells us something about this.

So this means that our model has inductive, uh, capability, which means that same aggregation parameters, same W and B, are shared across all nodes.
Uh, and the number of model parameters in this case is sublinear with the size of the network, because W and B only depend on the embedding dimensionality and the size, number of features, and not on the size of the graph.

This is also very useful for the networks that constantly evolve because you can take the snapshot of the network, create the computation graphs here, and determined the parameters so that when then in production, and you know, derives, you quickly create a computation graph for it.

801,FgzM3zpZ55o,stanford,"You'd only have one data point for every state.
There would be no repeating.
So, it's really hard to learn because um, they're- all states are different.
Um, and in general if we wanna learn how to do something, we're gonna either need some form a generalization or some form of clustering or aggregation so that we can compare experiences, so that we can learn from prior similar experience in order to what to do.
So, if we think about assuming that your observation is your state, so the most recent observations that the agent gets, we're gonna treat that as the state.
Then we- the agent is modelling the world is that Markov decision process.
So, it is thinking of taking an action, getting observation and reward, and it's setting the state, the world state- that the environment state it's using to be the observation.
If the world- if it is treating the world as partially observable um, then it says the agent state is not the same, um, and it sort of uses things like the history or beliefs about the world state to aggregate the sequence of previous actions taken and observations received, um, and uses that to make its decisions.
For example, in something like poker, um, you get to see your own cards.
Other people have cards that are clearly affecting the course of the game.
Um, but you don't actually know what those are.
You can see which cards are are discarded And so that's somewhere where it's naturally partially observable.","1. What is the Markov decision process, and how does it relate to reinforcement learning?

1479,gGQ-vAmdAOI,mit_cs,"We might have a shortest path to the goal.
Actually, that's not quite true, is it? We can't really quit until every other path is it.
Well, that's interesting.
If the first element on the queue gets us all the way to the goal, and we sorted our queue by path length, are we through as soon as that first element on the queue gets us to the goal? Yeah because every other path must have been sorted beyond it.
And therefore, it can't offer us a shorter path to the goal.
So if the first path is a path to the goal we're done.
Alas, it usually isn't.

AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: Let's start.
So today we're going to do some NP hardness reductions.
So let's just do a quick recap of P and NP.
So let's see.
So P is-- so you have a decision problem.
So I have an input x and you have some algorithm, A, and it spits out an answer, which is either 0 or 1.
So that's a decision problem.
And if a problem isn't P, this algorithm A runs in polynomial time.
So what about NP? So NP is when the solution is verifiable in polynomial time.
So let's say you have an input x and some oracle, which is [INAUDIBLE] run exponential time or is has infinite computation time gives you an answer, so you get x and you get an answer which is either 0 or 1.
And you also get a certificate.
So let's call that a certificate.
And given these three values, you can verify whether the solution was correct or not in polynomial time.
Make sense? So clearly if you're going to compute the answer in polynomial time, you can also verify in polynomial time.","1. What is the definition of a decision problem in computational complexity?

3449,2P-yW7LQr08,mit_cs,"And in the general setting, we have resources and requests, and we're going to have a single resource for our first version of the problem.
And our requests are going to be 1 through n, and we can think of these requests as requiring time corresponding to the resource.
So the request is for the resource, and you want time on the resource.
Maybe it's computation time.
Maybe it's your time.
It could be anything.
Each of these requests responds to an interval of time, and that's where the name comes from.
si is start time time.
fi is the finish time, and we're going to say si is strictly less than fi.
So I didn't put less than or equal to there because I want these requests to be non-null, non-zero, so otherwise they're uninteresting.
And we're going to have a start time, and we're going to have an end time, and they're not equal.
So that's the first part of the specification of the problem and then the second part, which is intuitive is that two requests-- we have a single resource here remember-- i and j are considered to be compatible, which means you can satisfy both of these requests.
They're compatible.
Incompatible requests, you can't satisfy with your single resource simultaneously-- Provided they don't overlap.
And an overlapping condition might be that fi is less than or equal to sg, or fj less than or equal to si.
So again, I put a less than or equal to here, which is important to spend a minute on.
What I'm saying here in this context is that I really have open-ended intervals on the right-hand side corresponding to the fi's.
So pictorially, you could look at it this way.
Let's say I have intervals like this.
So this is interval number 1.
That's interval number 2.
Right here I have s of 1, f of 1 out here, s of 2 out here, and f of 2 out here.","1. Is there a real-world example that can illustrate how interval scheduling works?

2538,MjbuarJ7SE0,mit_cs,"So this is how you write the function.
The first is whoops-- the first is going to be this def keyword.
And def stands for-- it tells Python I'm going to define a function.
Next is the name of the function.
In this case, I'm calling the function is_even.
And the function name should really be something descriptive.
Whereas someone who is just using this function or looking at it can pretty much tell what it's supposed to do without going a lot farther than that.
They're just looking at the name.
And then in parentheses you give it any parameters, also known as arguments.
And these parameters are the inputs to the function.
And then you do colon.
OK so this is the first line of the function definition.
And after this, everything that's going to be part of the function is going to be indented.
The next part is going to be the docstring, or the specification, and this is how we achieve abstraction using functions.
Specification, or the docstring, starts with triple quotes and ends with triple quotes, and you can sort of think about this as a multi-line comment.
It's just going to be text that's going to be visible to whoever uses the function, and it should tell them the following things: What are the inputs to the function? What is the function supposed to do generally? And what is the function going to give back to whoever called it? The next part is going to be the body of the function.
We'll talk about what's inside it in the next slide.

Take all the items you want to store.
And you're really tempted to store them in sorted order, but I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to use some other divide and conquer order.
First thing I'm going to do is take those elements, put them in a perfectly balanced binary search tree.

So then maybe the median's up here.
And then there's two children and so on.
OK, the mean's over here.
The max is over here, a regular BST.
Now we know how to search in a tree.
You just walk down.
The big question is, in what order should I store these nodes? If I just store them in a random order, this is going to be super bad-- log n memory transfers.
But I claim, if I do a clever order, I can achieve log base b of n, which is optimal.

239,rmVRLeJRkl4,stanford,"And so in particular, people suggested this analogy task.
And so the idea of the analogy task is you should be able to start with a word like king, and you should be able to subtract out a male component from that, add back in a woman component, and then you should be able to ask, well, what word is over here? And what should like is that the word over there is queen.
And so this sort of little bit of-- so we're going to do that, with this sort of same most similar function which is actually more-- so as well as having positive words, you can ask for most similar negative words and you might wonder what's most negatively similar to a banana, and you might be thinking, oh it's-- I don't know, some kind of meat or something.
Actually that by itself isn't very useful because when you just ask for most negatively similar to things, you tend to get crazy strings that were found in the data set that you don't know what they mean if anything.
But if we put the two together, we can use the most similar function with positives and negatives to do analogies.
So we're going to say we want a positive king, we want to subtract out negatively man, we want to then add in positively woman and find out what's most similar to this point in the space.
So my analogy function does that, precisely that by taking a couple of most similar ones and then subtracting out the negative one.
And so we can try out this analogy function.
So I can do the analogy, I show in the picture with man is the king as woman is-- sorry I'm not saying that's right.
Yeah, man is the king as woman is to-- well, sorry I haven't done my cells.
OK, man is to king as woman is to queen.
So that's great, and that works well.
I mean-- and you can do it the sort of other way around, king is to man as queen is to woman.

And then I have this z is equal to g of x.

So here is the scope of g.
With the scope of g, I'm mapping variables to actual parameters to formal parameters.

Or it's not really even something that you might want to call an algorithm.
It's a little computation.
And our goal now is to maximize the amount of money when assuming you move first.

And there's going to be a sequence of moves here.
You're going to move first, so that one is easy.
You've got the whole problem.
But now you have to say, the opponent is going to move and pick a coin.

So, now, we need to show that this is somehow bounded by a star G.
So how do you do that? Well, look at H star G.
What is H star G? H star G is just a cycle, which goes through the optimal cycle, which goes through all the vertices and comes back to the parent vertex.
So this is H star of G.
This is the optimal thing.
Now, you can take an edge, e, here, and delete it.
And then you'll get a spanning tree, because this is your optimal cycle.
Remove one edge, and you get a spanning tree.
So let's call that T dash.
Does that make sense, why that is a spanning tree? Because you had a cycle, and you remove one edge, so it touches all the vertices, and it's a tree.
So it's a spanning tree, but it's not the minimum spanning tree.
So you know that H star G, the cost of H star of G, is greater than equal to the cost of H star of G minus the edge we removed, is greater than equal to the cost of T.
Make sense? So you remove one edge, and then that is still greater than the minimum spanning tree.

It's, it's this value Gamma [NOISE] which is between 0 and 1.
And I'll talk [NOISE] about this later don't worry about [NOISE] it right now.
But it's a thing to define for our search pro- er, for our MDPs, okay? All right.
So how do I compare this with search? Again, these were the things that we had in a search problem.
We had the successor function that would deterministically take me to S prime and we had this cost function that would tell me what was the cost of being in state S and taking action A.
So, so the major things that are changed is that instead of the successor function, I have transition probabilities these T's, that, that basically tell me what's the probability of starting in S, taking action A, and ending up in S prime.
And then the cost just became reward, okay? So, so those are kind of the major differences between search and MDP.
Because things are- things are not deterministic here [NOISE], okay? All right, so, so that was the formalism.
Now, now I can define any, any MDP model- any Markov Decision Process.
And then one thing- just one thing to point out is this transition probability is this t, basically specifies the probability of ending up in state S prime if you take action A in state S.
So, so these are probabilities, right? So, so for example again, like we have done this example but let's just do it on the slides again, if I'm in state in, I take action quit, I end up in end, what's the probability of that? 1.
And then if I'm in state in, I take action stay, I end up in state in again, what's the probability of that? I end up in again, two-thirds.

So you take two rank one matrices, you add them up.
[inaudible].
You get a rank two matrix.
So you take two rank one matrices and you add them up, you can- you get a rank two matrix.
Assuming the vectors are linearly independent.
Okay? If the vectors are linearly independent, you take two rank one matrices, add them up, you get a rank two matrix.
Now, what happens if, let's say we add, um, k of them, so 1, 2.
What's the rank of this matrix? Rank k.
So the rank of this matrix is actually going to be the less than or equal to mean of d, p, and k.
So the rank of the matrix cannot be bigger than the smaller dimension of the matrix.
All right? So by adding the rank one matrices or, you know, um, or linear- adding the linearly independent rank one matrices, you're increasing the rank of your, um, uh, resulting matrix, but you can only go up as high as the smaller of the two dimensions.
Yes.
Question.
Can you define the rank, please? Yes.
We will, I- I will define the rank.
For now, let's- let's think of a rank as, um, think of this as a sheet of paper.

Right? And just by looking at a matrix, if you're just given a- a bunch of numbers of- of rows and columns, it's pretty much impossible to tell what the rank of that matrix is.

But you know, if I can't, how do I stay away from exponential algorithms? And finally, what we're going to show later on is that, in fact, there are some problems that, as far as we know, are fundamentally exponential.
And they're expensive to compute.
The very last thing is, you might have decided I was cheating in a different way.
So I'm using a set of built-in Python functions.
I'm not going to go through all of these.
But this is just a list, for example, for lists, of what the complexity of those built-in functions are.
And if you look through the list, they kind of make sense.
Indexing, you can go straight to that point.
Computing the length, you compute it once, you've stored it.
Comparison-- order n, because I've got to compare all the elements of the list.
Similarly, to remove something from the list, I've got to find where it is in the list and remove it.
Worst case, that's going to be order n.
So you can see that these operations are typically linear in the size of a list.
These are constant.
For dictionaries, remember, dictionaries were this nice thing.
They weren't ordered.
It gave me a power in terms of storing them.
But as a consequence, some of the costs then go up.
For a list, indexing, going to a particular point, I just go to that spot and retrieve it.
Indexing into a dictionary, I have to find that point in the dictionary that has the key and get the value back.
So that's going to be linear, because I have to, in principle, walk all the way down it.
It's a slight misstatement, as we'll see later on.
A dictionary actually uses a clever indexing scheme called a hash.

It just knows how to label this picture.

And the way the following set of pictures was produced was this.
You take an image, and you separate it into a bunch of slices, each representing a particular frequency band.
And then you go into one of those frequency bands and you knock out a rectangle from the picture, and then you reassemble the thing.
And if you hadn't knocked that piece out, when you reassemble it, it would look exactly like it did when you started.
So what we're doing is we knock out as much as we can and still retain the neural net's impression that it's the thing that it started out thinking it was.","1. How does the Google paper's algorithm work to put captions on pictures?

2834,uK5yvoXnkSk,mit_cs,"We could write a dynamic programming solution to the knapsack problem-- and we will-- and run it on this example, and we'd get the right answer.
We would get zero speedup.
Because at each node, if you can see, the problems are different.
We have different things in the knapsack or different things to consider.
Never do we have the same contents and the same things left to decide.
So ""maybe"" was not a bad answer if that was the answer you gave to this question.
But let's look at a different menu.
This menu happens to have two beers in it.
Now, if we look at what happens, do we see two nodes that are solving the same problem? The answer is what? Yes or no? I haven't drawn the whole tree here.
Well, you'll notice the answer is yes.
This node and this node are solving the same problem.
Why is it? Well, in this node, we took this beer and still had this one to consider.
But in this node, we took that beer but it doesn't matter which beer we took.
We still have a beer in the knapsack and a burger and a slice to consider.
So we got there different ways, by choosing different beers, but we're in the same place.
So in fact, we actually, in this case, do have the same problem to solve more than once.

That's not really necessary.

If I know what I've taken, I could already always compute the value and what's left.

This term, with Ana and John, I'm going to be splitting the lectures, so I'm up to date.
OK last time Ana introduced the first of the compound data types, tuples and lists.
She showed lots of ways of manipulating them, lots of built in things for manipulating those structures.
And the key difference between the two of them was that tuples were immutable, meaning you could not change them, lists were mutable, they could be changed, or mutated.
And that led to both some nice power and some opportunities for challenges.
And, in particular, she showed you things like aliasing, where you could have two names pointing to the same list structure, and because of that, you could change the contents of one, it would change the appearance of the contents of the other, and that leads to some nice challenges.","1.

They can be made to support insertion and deletion at both ends in constant time.

Now let's talk about temporal difference learning.
So, if you look at Sutton and Barto, um, and if you talk to Rich Sutton or, ah, number of, uh, and a number of other people that are very influential in the field, they would probably argue that these central, um, contribution to reinforcement learning or contribution to reinforcement learning that makes it different perhaps than some other ways of thinking about adaptive control, is the notion of temporal difference learning.
And essentially, it's going to just combine between Monte Carlo estimates and dynamic programming methods.
And it's model-free.
We're not going to explicitly compute a dynamics model or reward model or an estimator of that from data and it both bootstraps and samples.
So, remember, dynamic programming as we've defined it so far, um, it bootstraps, er, and the way we have thought about it so far you actually have access to the real dynamics model and the real reward model, but it bootstraps by using that VK minus one.
Monte Carlo estimators do not bootstrap.
They go all the way out to the end of the trajectory and sum up the rewards, but they sample to approximate the expectation.","1. What is temporal difference learning and how does it relate to reinforcement learning?

Otherwise you could think about having an index at each end of this thing and sort of counting into the middle, but it's much easier to say take the two at the end, if they're the same, then check to see what's left in the middle is a palindrome, and if those two properties are true, I'm done.
And notice what I just did I nicely reduced a bigger problem to a slightly smaller problem.
It's exactly what I want to do.
OK? So it says to check is this, I'm going to reduce it to just the string of characters, and then I'm going to check if that's a palindrome by pulling those two off and checking to see they're the same, and then checking to see if the middle is itself a palindrome.
How would I write it? I'm going to create a procedure up here, isPalindrome.
I'm going to have inside of it two internal procedures that do the work for me.
The first one is simply going to reduce this to all lowercase with no spaces.
And notice what I can do because s is a string of characters.
I can use the built in string method lower, so there's that dot notation, s.lower.
It says.
apply the method lower to a string.
I need an open and close per end to actually call that procedure, and that will mutate s to just be all lowercase.
And then I'm going to run a little loop, I'll set up answer or ans to be an empty string, and then, for everything inside that mutated string, I'll simply say, if it's inside this string, if it's a letter, add it into answer.
If it's a space or comma or something else I'll ignore it, and when I'm done just return answer, strips it down to lowercase.
And then I'm going to pass that into isPal which simply says, if this is either 0 or 1 long, it's a palindrome, returned true.
Otherwise, check to see that the first and last element of the string are the same, notice the indexing to get into the last element, and similarly just slice into the string, ignoring the first and last element, and ask is that a palindrome.
And then just call it, and that will do it.
And again there's a nice example of that in the code I'm not going to run it, I'll let you just go look at it, but it will actually pull out something that checks, is this a palindrome.

1940,UHBmv7qCey4,mit_cs,"What about overfitting? Because all this does is drape a solution over the samples.
And like support vector machines overfit, neural maps overfit, identification trees overfit.
Guess what? This doesn't seem to overfit.
That's an experimental result for which the literature is confused.
It goes back to providing an explanation.
So this stuff is tried on all sorts of problems, like handwriting recognition, understanding speech, all sorts of stuff uses boosting.
And unlike other methods, for some reason as yet imperfectly understood, it doesn't seem to overfit.
But in the end, they leave no stone unturned in 6.034.
Every time we do this, we do some additional experiments.
So here's a sample that I'll leave you with.
Here's a situation in which we have a 10-dimensional space.
We've made a fake distribution, and then we put in that boxed outlier.
That was just put into the space at random, so it can be viewed as an error point.
So now what we're going to do is we're going to see what happens when we run that guy.
And sure enough, in 17 steps, it finds a solution.
But maybe it's overfit that little guy who's an error.
But one thing you can do is you can say, well, all of these classifiers are dividing this space up into chunks, and we can compute the size of the space occupied by any sample.
So one thing we can do-- alas, I'll have to get up a new demonstration.
One thing we can do, now that this guy's over here, we can switch the volume tab and watch how the volume occupied by that error point evolves as we solve the problem.
So look what happens.
This is, of course, randomly generated.
I'm counting on this working.
Never failed before.
So it originally starts out as occupying 26% of the total volume.
It ends up occupying 1.4 times 10 to the minus 3rd% of the volume.
So what tends to happen is that these decision tree stumps tend to wrap themselves so tightly around the error points, there's no room for overfitting, because nothing else will fit in that same volume.
So that's why I think that this thing tends to produce solutions which don't overfit.
So in conclusion, this is magic.
You always want to use it.
It'll work with any kind of [? speed ?] of classifiers you want.
And you should understand it very thoroughly, because of anything is useful in the subject in dimension learning, this is it.

What do you do? Just like over here, if I'm trying to insert an item, I search for that item over here.
So if I'm trying to insert at i, for example, I look for i.
And then for insert_at i, want to add a new item just before that one.
And conveniently, we already have-- I didn't mention, but we have a subtree insert.
We had two versions-- before and after.
I think we covered after, which I use successor before I use predecessor.
But we can just call subtree insert before at that node, and boom, we will have added a new item just before it.
And great, so magically, somehow, we have inserted in the middle of this sequence.
And all of the indices update, because I'm not storing indices.
Instead, to search for an item at index i, I'm using the search algorithm.
But there's a problem.
What's the problem? This seems a little too good to be true.
I insert in the middle of this tree, and then somehow, I can magically search and still find the ith item, even though all the indices to the right of that item incremented by 1.
It's almost true.
Answer? Yeah? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] ERIK DEMAINE: Because we have to update the sizes, right.
I didn't say, how do I compute the size of the left subtree? So that is the next topic.

So the number of triangles on the path is, at most, log n divided by how much progress we make for each triangle, which is half log b-- also known as 2 times log base b of n.
And then we get the number of memory transfers is, at most, twice that.
So the number of memory transfers is going to be, at most, 4 times log base b of n.
And that's order log base b of n, which is optimal.

B trees get basically 1 times log base b of n.

2937,CHhwJjR0mZA,mit_cs,"So you might call this a specification.
And in the context of data structures, we're trying to store some data.
So the interface will specify what data you can store, whereas the data structure will give you an actual representation and tell you how to store it.
This is pretty boring.
Just storing data is really easy.
You just throw it in a file or something.
What makes it interesting is having operations on that data.
In the interface, you specify what the operations do, what operations are supported, and in some sense, what they mean.
And the data structure actually gives you algorithms-- this is where the algorithms come in-- for how to support those operations.
All right.
In this class, we're going to focus on two main interfaces and various special of them.
The idea is to separate what you want to do versus how to do it.
Because-- you can think of this as the problem statement.
Yesterday-- or, last class, Jason talked about problems and defined what a problem was versus algorithmic solutions to the problem.
And this is the analogous notion for data structures, where we want to maintain some data according to various operations.
The same problem can be solved by many different data structures.
And we're going to see that.
And different data structures are going to have different advantages.
They might support some operations faster than others.
And depending on what you actually use those data structures for, you choose the right data structure.

So, local state could just be the current observation.
That starts to be important when you're going down here because there are many places that looked like that.

So you can figure out which is better, just locally.
But then there's another thing I can do, which is maybe I hit this pin in a pair with some other pin.
Now, there's no pin to the left of this one.
We're assuming we only have the suffix.
And so the only other thing I can do is throw a ball and hit i together with i plus 1.
And then I get the product.
Now, what pins remain? i plus 2 on.
Still a suffix.
So if I remove one or two items, of course, I still get a suffix-- in this case, b of i plus 2-- and then the number of points that I add on are vi times vi plus 1.
So this is a max of three things.
So how long does it take me to compute it? I claim constant time.
If I don't count the time it takes to compute these other sub problems, which are smaller because they are smaller suffixes further to the right, then I'm doing a couple of additions-- product, max.
These are all nice numbers and I'll assume that they live in the w-bit word, because we're only doing constant sized products.
That's good.
So this takes constant, constant non-recursive work.
How many sub problems are? Well, it's suffixes, so it's a linear number of sub problems.
And so the time I'm going to end up needing is number of sub problems, n, times the non-recursive work I do per sub problem, which is constant.

And it'll print out that string.
So the idea is one of the features of Python that makes it easy to learn is the fact that it's interpreter based.
You can play around.
You can learn by doing.
Now, of course, if the only thing it did was simple data structures, it would not be very useful.
So the next more complex thing that it can do is think about combinations.
If you type ""2 + 3,"" it says, oh, I got it.
This person's interested in a combination.
I should combine by the plus operator two ints, 2 and 3.
Oh, and if I do that, if I combine by the plus operator two and three, I'll get 5.
So it prints 5.
So that's a way you know that it interprets ""2 + 3"" as 5.
Similarly here, except I've mixed types.

OK, well I'll upgrade the int to a float.
I'll do the float version, and I'll get this, which is its representation of 8.7.
So the idea is that it will first try to interpret what you're saying as a simple data type.
If that works, it prints the result to tell you what it thinks is going on.
It then will try to interpret it as an expression.
And sometimes, the expressions won't makes sense.
In particular, if you try to add an int to a string, it's going to say, huh? And over the course of the first two weeks, we hope that you get familiar with interpreting this kind of mess.
That's Python's attempt to tell you what it was trying to do on your behalf and can't figure out what you're talking about.
OK, so that was simple.
But it already illustrates something that's very important, and that's the idea of a composition.
So the way Python works, the fact that when you added 3 to 2 it came out 5, what we were doing was composing complicated-- well, potentially complicated (that was pretty simple) -- potentially complicated expressions and reducing them to a single data structure.

2633,RvRKT-jXvko,mit_cs,"So it's not going to look any further than that.
So it's going to say, this is an integer, this is a string, this is an integer, this is a list.
It's not going to say how many elements are in this list.
It's just going to look at the outer-- the shell of elements.
Indexing and slicing works the same way.
So l at position 0 gives you the value 2.
You can index into a list, and then do something with the value that you get back.
So l at position 2 says-- that's this value there and add one to it.
L at position 3, that's going to be this list here.
Notice it evaluates to another list.
You're not allowed to index outside of the length of the list.
So that's going to give you an error, because we only have four elements.
And you can also have expressions for your index.
So this-- Python just replaces i with 2 here and says, what's l at position 1? And then grabs that from in there.
OK.
So very, very similar to the kinds of operations we've seen on strings and tuples.
The one difference, and that's what we're going to focus on for the rest of this class, is that lists are mutable objects.
So what does that mean internally? Internally, that means let's say we have a list l, and we assign it-- sorry.
Let's say we have a variable l that's going to point to a list with three elements, 2, 1, and 3.
OK.
They're all-- each element is an integer.
When we were dealing with tuples or with strings, if we re-assign-- if we try to do this line right here, we've had an error.
But this is actually allowed with lists.
So when you execute that line, Python is going to look at that middle element, and it's going to change its value from a 1 to a 5.
And that's just due to the mutability nature of the list.
So notice that this list variable, this variable l, which originally pointed to this list, points to the exact same list.","1. What are tuples and how do they differ from lists?

Everybody? Yeah, it's just 1, right? Because there's nothing to do.
An array of length 1 has one element and it's sorted.
It's also the biggest element and the smallest element.
And now, what does our algorithm do? Well, it makes two recursive calls on lists that are half the length.
And then it calls that merge function.
And we know that the merge function takes theta of n time.
Does that make sense? So one thing we might do, because we have some intuition from your 6042 course, is that we think that this thing is order n log n because it makes the two recursive calls.
And then it puts them together.
And let's double check that that's true really quick using the substitution method.

4702,51-b2mgZVNY,mit_cs,"PROFESSOR: The final general counting rules that we'll examine is called inclusion-exclusion, and it is a straightforward generalization of the sum rule-- at least in the simple case of two sets that we'll look at first.
So we're going to look at 6042 example of applying inclusion-exclusion, but let's begin by stating what it is.
So the sum of the rule says that if you have two sets A and B that are disjoint-- no overlap between A and B-- then the size of A union B is equal to the size of A plus the size of the B.
Well that's obvious.
We took that as kind of basic axiom.
But what if they're not disjoint? Suppose that A and B overlap, and there's some stuff in here that's the intersection of A and B where there are points in common, what then is the size of A union B in terms of simpler things that we can count? And the answer is that the size of A union B is the size of A plus the size of B minus the size of A intersection B.
Now, the intuitive reason for that-- and it's not really very hard to make a precise argument-- is that when you're adding up the elements in A, you're counting all the elements of the intersection once.","1. What is the inclusion-exclusion principle and why is it important in set theory?

Uh, nothing's disconnected.
So I can't do anything.
And last, I have to do actual work.
Okay.
So what does actual work mean here? I'm interested in the probability of B.
So I need a marginalize out E.
Now, I have to do this kind of a hard way, um, based on last time, uh, last lecture.
So, um, what I'm gonna do here is, you know, what happens when I marginalize out E? I create a new factor.
Let, let me actually replicate this down here, so it doesn't get too confusing.
Um, so I'll create a new factor, and this new factor that's called f of b, um, which is the Markov [NOISE] negative E, there's only one other variable B.
And this is going to be the product of all the factors here that touched this variable that I'm marginalizing out.

1201,p61QzJakQxg,stanford,"But the intuition there is that by penalizing B, you're restricting the algorithm to have a hyperplane that's close to 0.
And that's, you know, that- that's seems pretty arbitrary.
[BACKGROUND] So- so the thing is w and b are kind of work differently.
So B tells you how far apart you can be from the origin and you don't want any kind of constraint over there.
Uh, so there is an equivalent dual problem, of i minus half Y i.
This is a double sum over i j, y i, y j, Alpha i Alpha j and inner product between x i x j such that 0 less than equal to Alpha I less than equal to c.
And sum over i equals 1 to n, Alpha i, y i equals 0.

And we're not going to treat everybody in a crowd equally.
We're going to wait some of the opinions more than others.
And by the way, they're all going to make errors in different parts of the space.
So maybe it's not the wisdom of even a weighted crowd, but a crowd of experts.
Each of which is good at different parts of the space.
So anyhow, we've got this formula, and there are a few things that one can say turn out.
But first, let's write down the an algorithm for what this ought to look like.
Before I run out of space, I think I'll exploit the right hand board here, and put the overall algorithm right here.
So we're going to start out by letting of all the weights at time 1 be equal to 1 over n.
That's just saying that they're all equal in the beginning, and they're equal to 1 over n.
And n is the number of samples.

No, I don't want to do that.
I want to I want to pick a classifier the minimizes the error rate.
And then m, i, zes, error at time t.
And that's going to be at time t.

You can crouch slide through here.

And I told you before about these sonar sensors.
From the sonar sensors, the robot has learned now that there seems to be something reflecting at each of these black dots.

So, we'll discuss pretraining more on Thursday.
And so our transformer is it.
The way that we described the Attention Is All You Need paper.
So, the transformer encoder decoder we saw was from that paper.
And at some point, we want to build new systems, what are some drawbacks? And we've already started-- People have already started to build variants of transformers, which we'll go into today.
And it definitely has issues that we can try to work on.
So I can also take a question if anyone wants to ask one.
I mean, is that the bit that something there were several questions on was the scale dot product.
And the questions included y square root of d divided by h, as opposed to just d divided by h, or any other function of d divided by h.
And another one was that, why do you need that at all, given that later on you're going to use layer norm? The second question is really interesting and not one that I had thought of before.
Well, right, so even if the individual components are small-- So let's start with the second question.
Why does this matter even if you're going to use layer norm? If layer norm is averaging everything out, say, making the unit standard deviation and mean, then actually, right, nothing is going to get too small in those vectors either.
So when you have a very, very large vector, all with things that aren't too small, yeah, you're still going to have the norm of the dot products increase.
I think.
And I think it's a good question.
I hadn't thought about it too much.
That's my off the cuff answer.
But it's worth thinking about more.
I think the answer is that the effect you get of kind of losing dynamic range as things get longer, that that's going to happen anyway.
And the layer norm can't fix that.
It's sort of coming along too late.
And, therefore, you gain by doing this scaling.
I think so.
But I think it's worth-- I think it's worth thinking about more.
why square root? Well, let's see.","1. Is the transformer encoder-decoder model mentioned the same as the original model proposed in the ""Attention Is All You Need"" paper?

4772,V_TulH374hw,mit_cs,"Associated with that, we can't just-- well, I should say, we could just have nodes, but that's kind of boring.
We want to know what are the connections between the elements in my system? And so the second thing we're going to have is what we call edges, sometimes called arcs.
And an edge will connect a pair of nodes.
We're going to see two different ways in which we could build graphs using edges.
The first one, the simple one, is an edge is going to be undirected.
And actually, I should show this to you.
So there is the idea of just nodes.
Those nodes, as I said, might have information in them, just labels or names.
They might have other information in them.
When I want to connect them up, the connections could be undirected.
If you want to think of it this way, it goes both ways.
An edge connects two nodes together, and that allows sharing of information between both of them.
In some cases, we're going to see that we actually want to use what we call a directed graph, sometimes called a digraph, in which case the edge has a direction from a source to a destination, or sometimes from a parent to a child.
And in this case, the information can only flow from the source to the child.
Now in the case I've drawn here, it looks like there's only ever a single directed edge between nodes.
I could, in fact, have them going both directions, from source to destination and a separate directed edge coming from the destination back to the source.
And we'll see some examples of that.
But I'm going to have edges.

43,L5uBeAGJV1k,mit_cs,"And if you want to skip the short discussion of the meta theorems, that's fine, because it's never going to come up again in this class.
So let's look at this phrase in English, where the poet says, ""all that glitters is not gold."" Well, a literal translation of that would be that, if we let G be glitters, and I can't use G again, so we'll say Au is gold, then this translated literally would say for every x, G of x, if x is gold implies that not gold of x.
So is that a sensible translation? Well, it's clearly false, because gold glitters like gold.
And you can't say that gold is not gold.
So this is not what's meant.
It's not a good translation.
It doesn't make sense.
Well, what is meant, well, when the poet says, ""all that glitters is not gold,"" he's really leaving out a key word to be understood from context.
All that glitters is not necessarily gold.
He was using poetic license.
You're supposed to fill in and understand its meaning.
And the proper translation would be that it is not true that everything that glitters is gold.
It is not the case that for all x, if x glitters, then x is gold.
So it's just an example where a literal translation without thinking about what the sentence means and what the poet who articulated this sentence intended will get you something that's nonsense.

I mean I understand that that doesn't make too much sense, but it's less than or equal to 4 log n plus a constant.
And that 4 is going to get reflected in the alpha here.
When the 4 goes from 4 to 8, the alpha increases.
So the more room that you have with respect to this constant, the higher the probability.
It becomes an overwhelming probability that you're going to be within those number of levels.
So maybe there's an 80% probability that you're within 2 log n.
But there's a 99.99999% probability that you're within 4 log n, and so on and so forth.

It's possible that you might end up with a different optimal solution that doesn't use the earliest finish time.
We think earliest finish time is optimal at this point.

The tried and trusted algorithm for public key encryption relies on a computational assumption where the problem associated with that assumption is not even known to be NPC.

So how does this work? Or why does this work? Now, if you take other problems, like, is a graph 3-colorable? And so what does that mean? Well, you have three colors.
And you're not allowed to reuse the same color on two ends of an edge.
So if you put red over here, you can put red here, but you can't put red here and there.
And so that graph is 3-colorable.
But if you had a click, then this would not be 3-colorable.
Because you have all these edges.
You have three edges coming out.
And so clearly, the degree from a vertex is going to tell you what you have.
So if you have a 4-click over there, immediately it's not 3-colorable.
But checking whether a graphic is 3-colorable is NPC.
You can use a three set as a way of showing that.

So the new top of the resulting fraction.
So it's my numerator multiplied by the other denominator plus my denominator multiplied by the other numerator and then divided by the multiplication of the two denominators.
So the top is going to be that, the bottom is going to be that.
Notice that we're using self dot, right? Once again, we're trying to access the data attributes of each different instance, right, of myself and the other object that I'm working with.
So that's why I have to use self dot here.
Once I figure out the top and the bottom of the addition, I'm going to return, and here notice I'm returning a fraction object.
It's not a number, it's not a float, it's not an integer.

So as you can see, every node has-- so the 2-3 is either two children or three children.
Every node can have either one key or two keys.
And the correlation is that every-- so if there are n keys in a node, it has n plus 1 children.
So the way that works is similar to binary search trees.

Let me give you an idea of how to fix the space bound.
Let's erase some algorithms.
The main idea here is only store non-empty clusters, pretty simple idea.
We want to spend space only for the present items, not for the absent ones.
So don't store the absent ones.
In particular, we're doing all this work around when clusters are empty, in which case we can see that just by looking at the min item, or when they're non-empty.
So let's just store the non-empty ones.
That will get you down to almost order n space, not quite, but close.
To do this, v dot cluster is no longer an array.
Just make it a hash table, a dictionary in Python.
So v dot cluster-- we were always doing v dot cluster of i.
Just make that into dictionary instead of an array.
And you save most of the space.
You only have to store the non-empty items.
And you should know from 006, hash table is constant expected.
We'll prove that formally in lecture eight, I think.
But for now, take hashing as given.
Everything we did before is essentially the same cost, but an expectation, no longer worst case.
But now the space goes way down.
Because if you look at an item, when you insert an item, it sort of goes to log log u different places, in the worst case.
But, yeah.
We end up with n log log u space, which is pretty good, almost linear space.

1497,gGQ-vAmdAOI,mit_cs,"AUDIENCE: I meant like, does the map-- PROFESSOR: So now I'm taking the sum of the actual distance, plus the estimated distance to go.
AUDIENCE: All right.
I'm just wondering if the original map has to be [INAUDIBLE].
PROFESSOR: See this is not a map.
She was asking if the map has to be geometrically accurate.
See, this could be a model of something that's not a map.
And so, I'm free to put any numbers on those links that I want, including estimates, as long as they're underestimates of the distance along the lengths.
So this tells me that my estimated distance here, so far, is 1.
So I'll, surely, go down here to C.
And if I go to C, then my accumulated distance is 11.
And my estimate of the remaining distance is 0.
So that's a total of 11.
So now I'm following my heuristic again and saying what's the shortest path on a base of the accumulated distance plus the estimated distance? Here, the accumulated distance plus the estimated distance is 101.
Here, it's only 11.
So plainly, I extend this guy.
And that gets me to the goal.
And the total accumulated distance is now 111 plus 0 equals 111.
And that's not the shortest path, but wait.
I still have to do my checking, right? I have to extend A.
I when I extend A, I get to B.
And now, when I get to B that way, my accumulated distance is 2 plus my-- oh, sorry.
S, A, C.
My accumulate distance it 2.
My estimated distance is 0, so that's equal to 2.

OK, sounds good.
What about the next one? So now we have xi or 0 of z.
So 0 of z is 0 and xi just went from being 1 to being 0.

So that's not good because now we are no longer satisfying Max-k-sat clause possibly because we had some number of satisfying clauses, which was above our threshold.
But now we lose a clause and we could be going below the threshold.
But then we look at the third clause.
And what that does is-- so let's say we look at this specific clause, the one which said that xi and xj.
Note that this clause exists because xi, xj is not an edge you need.
And therefore, by that condition, this clause exists in the set of clauses.
So what was the value of this clause initially before? In the initial assignment, what was the value of this clause? Note that i and j are both in V dash.
What was the value of this clause in the original assignment? Before we set xi to 0? What was the value of xi in the original assignment? AUDIENCE: 1.

xj was also in V dash because that's the anomaly we saw it, right? There was not an edge in the clique.

But what I'm saying here for the base is slightly different.
It says that the optimal solution has a single interval, right?

2319,tKwnms5iRBU,mit_cs,"And this may happen recursively, whatever.
That's essentially what makes a recurrence work for dynamic programming.
And with dynamic programming, for this to be possible, we need to guess some feature of the solution.
For example, in minimum spanning tree, maybe you guess one of the edges that's in the right answer.
And then, once you do that, you can reduce it to some other subproblems.
And if you can solve those subproblems, you combine them and get an optimal solution to your original thing.
So this is a familiar property.
I don't usually think of it this way for dynamic programming, but that is essentially what we're doing via guessing.
But with greedy algorithms, we're not going to guess.
We're just going to be greedy.
Eat the largest cookie.
And so that's the greedy choice property.
This says that eating the largest cookie is actually a good thing to do.
If we keep making locally optimal choices, will end up with a globally optimal solution.

So I'm going to answer to you where ignorability comes up, but it's up to you to figure out where does common support show up.
So what is common support? Well, what common support says is that there always must be some stochasticity in the treatment decisions.
For example, if in your data patients only receive treatment A and no patient receives treatment B, then you would never be able to figure out the counterfactual, what would have happened if patients receive treatment B.
But what happens if it's not quite that universal but maybe there is classes of people? Some individual is X, let's say, people with blue hair.
People with blue hair always receive treatment zero and they never see treatment one.
Well, for those people, if for some reason something about them having blue hair was also going to affect how they would respond to the treatment, then you wouldn't be able to answer anything about the counterfactual for those individuals.
This goes by the name of what's called a propensity score.

And multiplication cost you one operation.
And you need to do n cubed multiplies to actually get the C matrix, and you have to verify it order n square time.
And so the number of multiplies, again, that you want to use in your verification algorithm has to be order n square.
We're ignoring the additions.
So that's what we'd like out of our matrix product checker, and the algorithm we're going to look at is called Freivald's algorithm, cute little algorithm, that does the following.
So the algorithm itself is very straightforward, in couple of lines, a minute or so to describe, and the interesting aspect of it is the analysis-- the fact that you can show this.
That's the cool part.
If you couldn't show that, there's nothing cool about this algorithm.
So we're going to choose a random binary vector.
So there you go.
Here's your randomness.
And this binary vector, every time you run it, as the k increases here, the random binary vector is different from one to another.
That's important.
You can't run the same thing again and then expect a different result.
That's called insanity.
But you are going to assume that given that we are working in the binary space and this is a binary vector, you're going to assume that r i equals 1 is half independently for i equals 1 through n.
And the algorithm essentially is this-- we're going to do a bunch of matrix vector multiplies.

So, your data is no longer IID.

Is it biased for an obvious reasons to inspectors paradox? [inaudible] I don't know.
That's a good question.
I'm happy to look at it and return.
However, the nice thing about this is that it is a consistent estimator.
So, as you get more and more data, it will converge to the true estimate.
And empirically, it often has way lower variance.
And intuitively, it should have way lower variance.
We're averaging over a lot more data points, uh, typically in the same.
Now, you know, if you only visit one- if you- if you're very unlikely to repeatedly visit the same state, these two estimators are generally very close to the same thing in an episode.
Because you're not gonna have multiple visits to the same state.
But in some cases you're gonna visit the same state a lot of times and you get a lot more data and these estimators will generally be much better if you use every visit, but it's biased.","1.

I don't want to go down.
I'm done.
And what I would find is I'm at a local maximum rather than a global maximum.
And that's the problem with greedy algorithms, that you can get stuck at a local optimal point and not get to the best one.
Now, we could ask the question, can I just say don't worry about a density will always get me the best answer? Well, I've tried a different experiment.
Let's say I'm feeling expansive and I'm going to allow myself 1,000 calories.
Well, here what we see is the winner will be greedy by value, happens to find a better answer, 424 instead of 413.

Sometimes this definition of best might work.
Sometimes that might work.
Sometimes no definition of best will work, and you can't get to a good solution-- you get to a good solution.

4910,5cF5Bgv59Sc,mit_cs,"It's basically going to be bookkeeping to-- distances are actually sufficient for us to reconstruct parent pointers if we need them later.
So what I'm going to show for you-- prove to you now is that, if I give you the shortest path distances for the subset of the graph reachable from s that doesn't go through negative weight cycles, if I'm giving you those distances, I can reconstruct parent pointers along shortest paths in linear time for any graph I might give you if I give you those shortest path distances.
OK, so that's what I'm going to try to show to you now.
So here's the algorithm.
For weighted-- there's the caveat here I'm going to write down.
For weighted shortest paths, only need parent pointers for v with finite shortest path distance-- only finite shortest path distance.
We don't care about the infinite ones or the minus infinite ones, just the finite ones.
OK, so here's the algorithm.
I can initialize all Pv to equal-- sorry, oh, getting ahead of myself.
I'm writing down DAG.
Init parent pointer data structure to be empty.
At first, I'm not going to sort any parent pointers.
But at the beginning, I'm going to set the parent pointer of the source to be none.

In the Cat class, we're going to add two more methods though.
The first is speak().
So speak() is going to be a method that's going to just take in the self, OK-- no other parameters.
And all it's doing is printing ""meow"" to the screen-- very simple, OK? So through this speak(), we've added new functionality to the class.
So an animal couldn't speak, whereas a cat says ""meow."" Additionally, through this __str__ method here, we're overriding the animal __str__, OK? So if we go back to the previous slide, we can see that the animal's __str__ had animal, plus the name, plus the age here whereas the cat's __str__ now says ""cat,"" name, and the age, OK? So this is just how I chose to implement this, OK? So here I've overridden the __str__ method of the Animal class.
Notice that this class doesn't have an __init__, and that's OK.
Because Python's actually going to say, well, if there's no __init__ in this particular method-- sorry, in this particular class-- then look to my parents and say, do my parents have an __init__, OK? And if so, use that __init__.

But you might think that 5 is a possibility, simply because the capacities of the edges that are coming out of the source are 3 plus 2, which is 5, right?

Imagine this object.

You can reconstruct any view of that object.

First of all, some of the vertexes are not visible in the views that you have.
So, of course, you can't do anything with those.

If you have three pictures of that, you can reconstruct any view of that object.

What's true is, you can produce any view of that in orthographic projection.
So if you're close enough to the object that you get perspective, it doesn't work.
But for the most part, you can neglect perspective after you get about two and a half times as far away as the object is big.
And you can presume that you've got orthographic projection.

807,FgzM3zpZ55o,stanford,"So, it's just landed.
Um, it's got a particular location and it can either try to go left or try to go the right.
I write down try left or try right meaning that that's what it's going to try to do but maybe you'll succeed or fail.
Let's imagine that there's different sorts of scientific information to be discovered, and so over in S1 there's a little bit of useful scientific information but actually over at S7 there's an incredibly rich place where there might be water.
And then there's zero in all other states.
So, we'll go through that is a little bit of an example.
As I start to talk about different common components of an oral agent.
So, one often common component is a model.
So, a model is simply going to be a representation of the agent has for what happens in the world as it takes its actions and what rewards it might get.
So, in the case of the markup decision process it's simply a model that says if I start in this state and I take this action A, what is the distribution over next states I might reach and it also is going to have a reward model that predicts the expected reward of taking, um, an action in a certain state.
So, in this case, ah, let's imagine that the reward of the agent is that it thinks that there's zero reward everywhere.
Um, and let's imagine that it thinks its motor control is very bad.
And so it estimates that whenever it tries to move with 50% probability it stays in the same place and 50% probability it actually moves.
Now the model can be wrong.
So, if you remember what I put up here the actual reward is that in state S1 you get plus one and in state S7 you get S you get 10 and everything else you get zero.","1. What is the concept of a model in reinforcement learning as described in the lecture?

2720,soZv_KKax3E,mit_cs,"Then you compute the mean and the standard deviation of that sample.
And then use the standard deviation of that sample to estimate the standard error.
And I want to emphasize that what you're getting here is an estimate of the standard error, not the standard error itself, which would require you to know the population standard deviation.
But if you've chosen the sample size to be appropriate, this will turn out to be a good estimate.
And then once we've done that, we use the estimated standard error to generate confidence intervals around the sample mean.
And we're done.
Now this works great when we choose independent random samples.
And, as we've seen before, that if you don't choose independent samples, it doesn't work so well.
And, again, this is an issue where if you assume that, in an election, each state is independent of every other state, and you'll get the wrong answer, because they're not.
All right, let's go back to our temperature example and pose a simple question.

217,rmVRLeJRkl4,stanford,"And so then we choose a fixed vocabulary which will typically be large but nevertheless truncated, so we get rid of some of the really rare words, so we might say vocabulary size of 400,000 and we then create for ourselves vector for each word.
OK, so then what we do is we want to work out what's a good vector for each word, and the really interesting thing is that we can learn these word vectors from just a big pile of text by doing this distributional similarity task of being able to predict, well, what words occur in the context of other words.
So in particular, we're going [AUDIO OUT] through in the texts, and so at any moment we have a center word C, and context words outside of it, which we'll call O.","1. What is meant by a ""fixed vocabulary"" in the context of NLP?

2326,tKwnms5iRBU,mit_cs,"I'm contracting e.
So this is G slash e.
This is G.
If I can find a minimum spanning tree in G slash e, I claim I can find one in the original graph G just by adding the edge e.
So I'm going to say if G prime is a minimum spanning tree, of G slash e, then T prime union e is a minimum spanning tree of G.
So overall, you can think of this as a recurrence in a dynamic program, and let me write down that dynamic program.
It won't be very good dynamic program, but it's a starting point.
This is conceptually what we want to do.
We're trying to guess an edge e that's in a minimum spanning tree.
Then we're going to contract that edge.
Then we're going to recurse, find the minimum spanning tree on what remains, and then we find the minimum spanning tree.
Then we want to decontract the edge, put it back, put the graph back the way it was.
And then add e to the minimum spanning tree.
And what this lemma tells us, is that this is a correct algorithm.
If you're lucky-- and we're going to force luckiness by trying all edges-- but if we start with an edge that is guaranteed to be in some minimum spanning tree, call it a safe edge, and we contract, and we find a minimum spanning tree on what remains, then we can put e back in at the end, and we'll get a minimum spanning tree of the original graph.
So this gives us correctness of this algorithm.
Now, this algorithm's bad, again, from a complexity standpoint.
The running time is going to be exponential.
The number of sub problems we might have to consider here is all subsets of edges.
There's no particular way-- because at every step, we're guessing an arbitrary edge in the graph, there's no structure.","1. What is a minimum spanning tree, and why is it important in graph theory?
